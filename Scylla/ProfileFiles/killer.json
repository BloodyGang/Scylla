Family is security and safety.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBut, even though he did his best, one of the kids got away. He tried to stop her, chasing after her as fast as he could, but she had help: another outsider, driving a truck. The evil trucker killed his brother, ran him over like he was a possum. In a fury, Leatherface leapt at him, the saw ready to avenge his family, but the trucker was too quick. He knocked Leatherface aside and turned his own saw against him.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs he watched the outsiders driving away, the rage, grief and pain combined with the worry about what would happen to his family now. They would surely return with the police, and the police would take his brothers, his Grandpa. Without them, what would he do? Without their commands, he would wither and die.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs his world collapsed, Leatherface spun in circles, swinging the saw all around, trying to fight off the myriad external threats that surrounded him.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThen another feeling overtook him. It came from outside his vision, crawling over his skin with cold dread. He realised that no matter what outsiders could do to him, there was something worse, something bigger that lived in the shadows. He was filled with a terror unlike any he had ever felt before. But it was almost comforting, like the fear he\u2019d felt with his family. The fear of disappointing them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHe was brought to a place that was familiar but unknowable, and he instinctively knew what he had to do. He couldn\u2019t fail it, the way he had his family. Outsiders would come but he would use his skills to overcome any threats. There would be screaming, but he could make the world quiet again. Until the only sound remaining was the blessed howl of the saw.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ELet the outsiders come.","tunables":{"SlasherAttackChainsawOpenTime":2,"TerrorRadius":3200,"MaxWalkSpeed":460,"SlasherAttackLFChainsawPercentTantrumPhaseDamage":0.75,"SlasherAttackChainsawHittingTime":0.30000001192092896,"SlasherAttackChainsawSucceedCooldownTime":2,"SlasherAttackChainsawMissCooldownTime":1.5,"SlasherAttackChainsawObstructCooldownTime":3,"SlasherAttackLFChainsawMaxAccelerationPercent":1,"CannibalChainsawMaxCharge":4,"CannibalChainsawChargeRate":1,"CannibalChainsawMaxNumberOfCharges":3,"CannibalChainsawMissCooldownIncrease":1,"CannibalChainsawMaxCooldownDuration":4.5,"CannibalTantrumMaxCharge":3,"CannibalTantrumChargeRate":1,"CannibalTantrumDurationIncrease":1,"CannibalTantrumMaxDuration":6,"CannibalChainsawDashDuration":2.5},"item":"Item_Slasher_LFChainsaw","outfit":["CA_Head01","CA_Body01","CA_W01"],"dlc":"Cannibal","image":"UI/Icons/CharPortraits/Cannibal/K09_TheCannibal_Portrait.png","perks":["BBQAndChilli","FranklinsLoss","InTheDark"]},"268435465":{"id":"Nightmare","name":"The Nightmare","role":"killer","difficulty":"intermediate","gender":"male","height":"average","bio":"A nightmare inducing Killer, passively forcing Survivors into his Dream World using his power, \u003Cb\u003EDream Demon\u003C/b\u003E.

Hiding behind a mask of warmth and friendliness, Freddy\u0027s actual temperament was known only to his victims. When those victims were finally heard, the parents of Springwood tracked Freddy down and took the law into their own hands. They thought fire had rid them of a monster that night, that their children were finally safe, but evil as strong as his has a way of surviving.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EYears passed, the horror was buried, the victims mercifully forgot. Then, somehow, Freddy returned, and dreams became nightmares once again.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFreddy focused his anger on those he felt had wronged him, building up to his one true obsession: Nancy Holbrook.

Here he would have his final revenge.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFreddy stalked the boy through the school\u0027s halls. He took his time, savoring every moment of the hunt.

They were his to play with.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThere was the boy, at the end of a long corridor. Too tired and scared to run anymore? Resigned to his fate? Freddy closed in, arms wide, claws raking the wall.

But not his school. It looked the same, but it felt different. His powers were tempered in some ways and focused in others. The boy had gone for now, but other prey walked the hallways. Some would be inconsequential; others would become his new favorites.

This event drove a rift between him and his father that never closed. As the boy grew, so did his father\u2019s resentment, and his drinking habit. By the time Kenneth was at school, they lived mostly separate lives.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAcademically, he was unremarkable, coasting by on his significant athletic prowess. He grew tall and strong, excelling at track events, but shunned any attempts to coax him into team sports.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOn his walk home from school, he would often find feathers on the ground and he soon began a collection, keeping them in a cigar box under his bed. With his father either at work or in an alcohol-induced stupor, Kenneth had hours to spend alone, transfixed by the regularity of the feathers\u2019 barbs and feeling the softness as he ran them over his lips. Watching the birds that came to the feeder in his garden, he imagined how soft they must be and resolved to catch one. He ingratiated himself with the local dentist, soon procuring some anesthetic. Using this, he rigged up a trap on the feeder, that he hoped would knock out a bird long enough that he could touch it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter a few failed attempts, he managed to trap a robin. As it lay in his hand, he felt a sudden rush, of a life at his mercy. He had planned to release it once it recovered from the anesthetic. Instead, as its eyes flickered back into consciousness and it began to struggle, his grip remained firm. His fingers slowly tightened around its throat, squeezing until its chest feathers were finally still. He disposed of the body, keeping just a feather, with which he started a new collection, discarding the others as \u2018fake\u2019.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy the late 1940s, Kenneth had left school and started working as a busboy at a local diner. He had also escalated to larger prey, like squirrels, raccoons and dogs, becoming skilled at customizing the anesthetic dosage for each.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn early 1954, a young man went missing and the town was turned upside down in the search. A few months later, Kenneth\u2019s father, while doing some work in the crawlspace under the house, found a cigar box. He broke it open and saw, to his horror, that it contained feathers, animal paws, and a man\u2019s finger.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EReturning from work, Kenneth saw his father leaving the crawlspace with a cigar box in his hands. He turned on his heel and never went home again.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter a few weeks of living rough, he encountered a traveling circus and, with his prodigious strength, was hired to work the ropes.

But, with the itinerant life providing few repercussions, he fell into bad habits. Drink, junk food, drugs, he indulged all of them to excess. For a time, these vices were enough, but then his old urges returned and his nomadic existence became a cover for him to resume killing. He stole clothes and makeup from performers, fashioning a disguise that would let him get close to his victims before he anesthetized them, bringing them back to his caravan, where they would awake to find themselves bound and at his mercy. He would finally get to have his fun, mentally and physically torturing them, their screams fueling him, before being lost in the night.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce their strength was at its lowest, he would carefully examine their fingers, searching for the prettiest, running them over his tongue to find the tastiest.

He\u2019d stopped attending school after being kicked out of the basketball team for shoving a referee into the stands. Yet Frank was a man of potential, who could light up a room despite his bleak childhood. At six years old, he\u2019d been taken away from Calgary to start a circuit of foster homes. No matter how many times he\u2019d lashed out, threw tantrums and got into fights, they\u2019d kept moving him to new, unfamiliar houses. His last move had been three years prior when his last foster dad, Clive Andrews, had picked him up from the adoption center. They\u2019d been on the road for seven hours before reaching a small bungalow in Ormond. It would be the longest time they\u2019d spend together. Clive was too busy trading cheques from Family Services for drinks at the bar.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOrmond was a small, stale place; a remote town of six thousand inhabitants where gray winters drag on for most of the year. Frank did everything he could to get into another adoptive family, but he changed his mind when he caught the attention of a beautiful girl. Julie was a popular girl who was convinced that she deserved better than a life in Ormond, and Frank, as an outsider, was her ticket out. Frank attended the parties she threw where everyone was younger than him and easily impressed, which he liked. He met the impulsive Joey, who liked to show off, and the shy, naive Susie, who was Julie\u2019s best friend.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThey would hang out at an abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond. Their time together was the perfect break from the boring conformity of their small, insignificant everyday lives. Frank saw it as an opportunity to shape their lack of experience into something powerful. He lined up nights of debauchery and rampage, testing their limits. Bullying, vandalism, and theft were essentially their weekend plans. It came to a point where they would do anything he asked. Nothing was off-limits when they put their masks on. One evening, Frank dared Joey to vandalize the store that had recently fired him. They snuck inside easily enough as the building was supposed to be empty after closing hours. But a cleaner who was still there grabbed Julie as soon as she came near. Hearing her stifled cries, a dark impulse took over Frank. He rushed to her aid knife in hand and, without hesitating, planted the blade into the cleaner\u2019s back.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs the group stared at Frank in shock, he ordered them to finish the job. Joey clenched his jaw, grabbed the knife, and stabbed the bleeding man in the ribs. Susie didn\u2019t want to do it. Frank shouted at her; they had to finish what they\u2019d started. Julie closed her eyes and jabbed the knife into the man\u2019s chest. She handed the wet blade to Susie: they were all in this together now. Susie stared at Julie in disbelief as Frank grabbed her trembling hands and inserted the knife deep into the man\u2019s throat. Frank told them to move fast: they mopped the blood off the floor, stashed the body in the trunk of Joey\u2019s car and drove up Mount Ormond.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAll four were digging in the muddy snow to dispose of the body when Frank spotted something moving through the woods. He grabbed his knife and broke from the group to check it out. The Fog thickened around Frank, becoming so dense that he soon could no longer see ahead. He retraced his steps and stumbled on an ominous trail. He followed the eerie path, as if called by the darkness. Julie, Susie, and Joey finished digging but Frank was nowhere to be seen. Julie spotted his muddy footsteps in the snow and the three of them followed the trail, which took them deeper into the woods. When Julie, Susie, and Joey did not return home that night, their parents thought they\u2019d run away with Frank. Each family came up with a different theory. The mood of the town changed, however, when a body was found by an abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond.","tunables":{"MaxWalkSpeed":460,"TerrorRadius":3200,"Frenzy_MovementSpeedModifier":60,"Frenzy_TerrorRadiusModifier":800,"Frenzy_Duration":10,"Frenzy_RechargeDuration":20,"Frenzy_UsagePercentNeededToStartFrenzy":1,"Frenzy_CooldownDuration":3,"Frenzy_PalletVaultDuration":0.8999999761581421,"Frenzy_WindowVaultDuration":0.8999999761581421,"Frenzy_PutCamperInBleedoutChargeBonus":20,"Frenzy_ChargeToLoseOnRemoveBleedoutTimeAttack":999,"Frenzy_ChargeToLoseOnNonFrenzyAttack":5,"Frenzy_ChargeToLoseOnMissedFrenzyAttack":999,"Frenzy_AllowManuallyEnd":1,"SlasherAttackFrenzyOpenTime":0.5,"SlasherAttackFrenzyHittingTime":0.30000001192092896,"SlasherAttackFrenzySucceedCooldownTimeHealthy":1,"SlasherAttackFrenzySucceedCooldownTimeInjured":1,"SlasherAttackFrenzyMissCooldownTime":0.22499999403953552,"SlasherAttackFrenzyObstructCooldownTime":0.22499999403953552,"Bolt_FOVModifier":15,"FrenzyAttackMaxAccelerationPercent":100},"item":"Item_Slasher_Frenzy","outfit":["KK_Head01","KK_Body01","KK_W01"],"dlc":"Kenya","image":"UI/Icons/CharPortraits/Kenya/K14_TheLegion_Portrait.png","perks":["Discordance","Ironmaiden","MadGrit"]},"268435470":{"id":"Plague","name":"The Plague","role":"killer","difficulty":"hard","gender":"female","height":"tall","bio":"A devout Killer, able to infect Survivors from a short distance using her power, \u003Cb\u003EVile Purge\u003C/b\u003E.

To process her shock and sorrow, she held onto the belief that the gods had a plan for her. Her new life was one of quiet servitude. She would tend to the gardens, prepare ceremonial meals, and polish ceremonial incense burners. At night, she would pray for a sign that would reveal her purpose.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhen she came of age, she attended the high-ranking priests during the yearly worshiping of the sea-goat, the god of water and creation. Swinging a censer down the great hypostyle hall, she cast thick black fumes that reached the cold towering stone pillars before dissipating. Her worries lifted, and the resulting bliss made her feel closer to the gods than ever. She worked herself to the bone each day that followed, fulfilling her duties while taking on new ones, as she aided the priests during purification rituals.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe priests were more and more in need of assistance. Cleansings were being performed daily to answer the demand from outside the high temple walls, where a catastrophic plague had resurfaced. Within months, the priests contracted the disease. It did not take long before they became too weak to perform any kind of ritual. Adiris, having assisted many purification rituals, was the only one able to carry on. The swelling panic had to be contained, even if by a novice.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAnxious before her first ceremony, Adiris visited the priests\u2019s sanctuary chamber. When she lit the candles, she noticed a narrow opening at the back. Sliding through the gap, she reached a crypt hidden under the sanctuary. The chamber was bare except for the golden statue of a woman, who stood with outstretched hands, her fingers covered in jewels. It was the sign Adiris had been waiting for.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe great hall was packed with followers who bowed down as Adiris entered. She strode to the brick altar and grabbed a ceremonial dagger forged in silver, her ruby ringed fingers wrapping around the blade like claws. The sudden display of luxury intrigued the followers, who were struck already by her youth and beauty.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs she began reciting the epic of creation, a woman at the back swooned and collapsed. Adiris rushed to her and noticed the black blisters covering her feet. Without hesitation, Adiris grabbed her sacred blade and swung it at her own foot, severing a toe. Then she offered the bloody part to the gods, asking them to protect the woman. A silence fell over the followers, who revered Adiris as their new priestess.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETales of her wealth, beauty, and devotion began to spread across the city as quickly as the disease. Soon, Adiris\u2019s followers called her the High Priestess of Babylon.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBut her faith was tried when she showed the first signs of infection; her cough became a mix of phlegm and blood, her neck erupted in abscesses, and her four-toed foot darkened. Ashamed of her condition, she began wearing a veiled headpiece and carried a censer that masked the rancid smell of sick that clang to her skin. Hoping to be saved, she kept performing the rituals, offering blessed water and food to her followers.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBut no ritual could save her. In a desperate attempt to appease the gods, Adiris banished herself from the city. She traveled north with a few followers, venturing through the cold woodlands of Urashtu, until it was no longer possible to walk.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThey camped in a damp cave, where Adiris lay in a pool of vomit. Her foot, which had turned black, was so swollen she could not go any further. Her followers and she realized the truth in that cave: they were all infected with the plague.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EKneeling among her retching followers, Adiris made one last prayer. The black fumes of incense rose into the damp air before being wiped off by a cold breeze.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENeither the body of Adiris nor her followers were ever found.

From the reports, the victims seemed chosen at random, yet the killer knew his way around in the houses. The multiple stab wounds indicated a personal motive. No traces of DNA were found. The local police were confounded: the murders were carried with fury akin to a crime of passion yet coldly premeditated.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe murderer also liked to stalk his targets. Two victims had reported being followed on their way home by a dark figure, a few days prior their death. The killer would follow them from Walleyes, a small bar in Northern Roseville, and snap pictures of them at home, while looking for a way in. He could watch the same victim for weeks, meticulously registering their habits and routines. When he felt the urge to kill, he\u2019d visit the most vulnerable victim on his list, and break inside the house quietly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe whole staff worked on the Roseville Murders story.

He wanted to surpass his father\u2019s reputation and end what he saw as the thinning of samurai culture with farmers often posing as samurai. His father tried to turn Kazan\u2019s attention to more noble pursuits, but Kazan refused to heed his advice, and borrowing his father\u2019s katana, he embarked on a dark pilgrimage to prove his worth and rid Japan of imposters. Ignoring the code that had been taught to him, Kazan killed imposters in the hills and the valleys, on the beaches and in the woodland. The killings were brutal, cruel and morbid. He humiliated farmers and warriors alike, yanking off their topknots and stripping them of their armor. His rage, bloodlust and perverse sense of honor knew no bounds. Monks believed he was possessed by something dark and otherworldly and cursed him while a noble lord began to call him \u2018Oni-Yamaoka,\u2019 the rageful samurai, an insult both to Kazan and his family.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EDetermined to redeem his family\u2019s name, Kazan now butchered anyone who dared call him Oni-Yamaoka.

Being called an ogre was more than he could bear and an ominous voice in his head urged him to strike down the lord who had desecrated his name.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs Kazan made for the lord\u2019s town, he suddenly found himself face to face with a samurai standing on a dirt road, blocking his way. Kazan readied his kanabo. Without a word, the samurai attacked and quickly secured the upper hand. But he hesitated. With a devastating blow, Kazan crushed the samurai\u2019s head and cracked his helmet. As Kazan approached the fallen samurai, he saw his father\u2019s face and staggered back to his haunches. His father stared at Kazan with mingled shame and regret as he issued his last breath. Kazan closed his eyes and screamed in agony until he could scream no more. When he opened his eyes again\u2026 his father was gone. Not only had he killed his father, but he had allowed thieves to steal his body for armor.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBitter, lost and disillusioned, Kazan roamed the land aimlessly with his father\u2019s voice rattling in his head, taunting him, reminding him of his failures, sending him into fits of uncontrollable black rage. One day, walking in the woods, Kazan happened upon an Oni statue. He stopped and stood motionless for a long moment. The weathered and overgrown statue seemed to be ridiculing him, accusing him of being the imposter samurai he had so desperately sought to destroy. Kazan shook the laughing voice out of his head and half remembered the lord who had ridiculed him as \u2018Oni-Yamaoka.\u2019\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWith renewed anger, Kazan journeyed to a town high up in the snowy mountains where the lord resided. A dozen samurai met Kazan at the gates of the town. A dozen samurai fell to his kanabo. His speed and strength were unmatched. His rage was incomprehensible. Covered in blood and gore, Kazan battled through the town and soon found the lord hiding in a villa. He dragged him out of a cabinet, sliced his tendons to immobilize him and watched him beg and squirm like a dog. Without hesitation, he thrust his fist into the lord\u2019s mouth and yanked out the wicked tongue that had desecrated his name.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESatisfied, Kazan exited the villa to find himself surrounded by dozens of farmers wielding rusted scythes, sharp pitchforks, and heavy clubs. He survived the first few assaults, but there were too many attackers coming from every direction. Within moments Kazan was on the ground staring at a cold, indifferent, darkening sky as farmers took turns stabbing and torturing the \u2018Oni\u2019 who had butchered their beloved lord. The frenzied mob dragged Kazan into a small stone mill to continue the torture and finally left him to die a slow, agonizing death. When they returned, the mill was filled with a strange black fog and Kazan\u2019s body and the kanabo were nowhere to be found. It was the beginning of a dark legend about a rageful Oni haunting the town.","tunables":{"TerrorRadius":3200,"MaxWalkSpeed":460,"BloodOrbAbsorbRange":50,"BloodOrbAttractRange":600,"BloodOrbAttractAngle":45,"BloodOrbAttractSpeed":1000,"BloodOrbSurvivorDropRange":800,"BloodOrbDropAfterCrouchBuffer":1,"BloodOrbDropNumOnCrouch":1,"BloodOrbDropNumOnGameEvent":2,"BloodOrbDropNumOnHook":2,"BloodOrbDropNumOnMissedSkillCheck":2,"BloodOrbDropNumOnPassiveDrop":2,"BloodOrbDropFrequencyInjured":4,"BloodOrbDropPauseAfterUnhookDuration":10,"BloodOrbMaxNumber":100,"BloodOrbVisibilityRangeAbsorbMode":3500,"BloodOrbVisibilityRangeOutOfAbsorbMode":3500,"BloodOrbVisibilityRangeAura":800,"DemonModeMaxCharge":100,"DemonModeChargeRate":0.20000000298023224,"DemonModeChargePerBloodOrb":2.5,"DemonModeChargeToAddOnAttack":40,"DemonModeAutoChargeThreshold":98,"DemonModeActivationDuration":3,"DemonModeActivationGamepadYawScale":44,"DemonModeActivationMouseYawScale":0.800000011920929,"DemonModeActivationChargeTime":0.07999999821186066,"DemonModeCooldownDuration":3,"DemonModeEndOnStunByPalletBelowThreshold":5,"DemonModeEndOnStunByPalletAboveThreshold":99,"OniDemonAttack_SecondsToCharge":2,"OniDemonModeThresholdForPowerAttack":0.3499999940395355,"OniDemonModeThresholdForCompletePowerAttack":0.3499999940395355,"OniPowerAttackOpenTime":0.5,"OniPowerAttackHittingTime":0.30000001192092896,"OniPowerAttackSucceedCooldownTime":3,"OniPowerAttackDamageDuringSuccessPhaseDuration":1.899999976158142,"OniPowerAttackMissCooldownTime":2,"OniPowerAttackObstructCooldownTime":2,"OniPowerAttackHitGamepadYawScale":27.5,"OniPowerAttackHitMouseYawScale":2.5,"OniPowerAttackCooldownGamepadYawScale":6.599999904632568,"OniPowerAttackCooldownMouseYawScale":0.11999999731779099,"OniPowerAttackCooldownGamepadPitchScale":13.75,"OniPowerAttackCooldownMousePitchScale":0.25,"OniPowerAttackOpenYawLimit":300,"OniPowerAttackOpenMaxTurnAngle":90,"DemonModeDashChargeTime":2,"DemonModeDashYawScale":44,"DemonModeDashCooldownDuration":1},"item":"Item_Slasher_Kanobo","outfit":["SwedenKiller_Head01","SwedenKiller_Body01","SwedenKiller_Weapon01"],"dlc":"Sweden","image":"UI/Icons/CharPortraits/Sweden/K18_TheOni_Portrait.png","perks":["BloodEcho","Nemesis","ZanshinTactics"]},"268435474":{"id":"Gunslinger","name":"The Deathslinger","role":"killer","difficulty":"hard","gender":"male","height":"tall","bio":"A vengeful Killer, able to spear Survivors from a distance and Reel them in using his power, \u003Cb\u003EThe Redeemer\u003C/b\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHis personal perks, \u003Cb\u003EGear Head\u003C/b\u003E, \u003Cb\u003EDead Man\u2019s Switch\u003C/b\u003E, and \u003Cb\u003EHex: Retribution\u003C/b\u003E,\u00A0allow him to locate and\u00A0impede\u00A0Survivor objectives, and punish Survivors for destroying Totems.","story":"Born in the dust-ridden badlands of the American Midwest, Caleb Quinn was son to struggling Irish immigrants. On the edge of the frontier, sickness, famine, and death were common sights, and pioneers contended for whatever scraps they could claim while tycoons feasted. Caleb\u0027s father, once an engineer, had few options to ply his trade as businesses\u00A0posted a common sign:\u00A0No Irish Need Apply. His antiquated tools\u00A0laid untouched for years until Caleb uncovered them. Noticing his son\u2019s interest in the trade, he gifted him his old wrench.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe devices Caleb made under his father\u2019s guidance had quaint applications, but when his father was away, they took a grim turn. He hid plans for a mask that would gouge barbed needles into a human\u2019s eyes and rip them from their sockets, complete with sketches of it fitted\u00A0on\u00A0boys\u00A0who bullied him.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWith age, Caleb\u0027s engineering abilities became marketable and employers put their discrimination aside. Henry Bayshore, the owner of United West Rail, hired him.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ECaleb first invented a\u00A0gun that shot railroad spikes into the ground. Next, he made a steam-powered tunneling drill. But as Bayshore feigned indifference, the devices began turning up at other companies, the patents stolen from Caleb and sold.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EA familiar sensation coursed through Caleb\u0027s blood, feeding the sharp pain in his heart. Rage overwhelming him, he burst into Bayshore\u2019s office and smashed his face into a bloody stew. As he was pulled away, he pushed his specialized gun to his boss\u2019 gut and squeezed the trigger. A railroad spike plowed through skin and viscera, nailing Bayshore to his desk.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe only thing that saved Caleb from hanging was Bayshore\u0027s unlikely survival. For fifteen years, Caleb was confined to\u00A0Hellshire\u00A0Penitentiary, the nation\u2019s first private prison. In a fortress of illiterate convicts, he found an unlikely friend in the educated prison warden. He designed torture devices for him and in return received extra meals. After a time, the warden offered to commute his sentence. He spoke of something greater than monetary wealth\u2014political capital\u2014and that his connections could have Bayshore framed and rotting behind bars for life. He had only one request: Make him rich. Fill the prison. Use ingenuity to bring outlaws in alive.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ECaleb returned to his workshop, and with a few modifications emerged with something new\u2014the speargun. The first trial occurred when a thief robbed a Chinese laundry. Seizing on the opportunity, Caleb unleashed his prototype. Metal joints screeched as the spike shot forward, gouging into the target\u0027s abdomen. But as the spear tugged it caught the thief\u0027s intestines and, with an ungodly sound, yanked them onto the dusty road.\u00A0After several iterations the disembowelments dwindled, but Caleb had already earned his new nickname: The\u00A0Deathslinger.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ELooking to protect his asset, the\u00A0prison warden pulled strings and released Irish inmates to form Caleb\u0027s posse. The\u00A0Hellshire\u00A0Gang was born.\u00A0For six years\u00A0they roamed the country collecting wanted outlaws for the prison, fulfilling their end of the bargain. After a bloody battle at\u00A0Glenvale, Caleb caught notice of a newspaper headline: Henry Bayshore Purchases\u00A0Hellshire\u00A0Penitentiary.\u00A0In the picture, a disfigured Bayshore proudly shook the warden\u2019s hand. Caleb\u0027s heart pounded with rage, blood swelling as if it would burst from his veins. He\u2019d been sold out, a pawn in a rich man\u0027s game.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe\u00A0Hellshire\u00A0Gang pledged their loyalty to Caleb and called for the warden\u2019s head. In a thundering gallop, they smashed through the prison entrance, shrieking like bloodthirsty marauders.\u00A0 A guard raised his pistol but hesitated. A spear\u00A0punctured\u00A0his chest. Caleb grabbed the man\u0027s head and slammed it against a prison cell\u00A0until it spilled through the bars.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EReaching the warden\u0027s office, Caleb kicked the door and was met with a fortunate sight\u2014it wasn\u2019t only the prison warden who cowered in a corner, but Henry Bayshore. Overpowered with rage, Caleb rushed Bayshore,\u00A0beating,\u00A0bludgeoning,\u00A0tearing\u00A0at his flesh. The man\u0027s blood dripped from his face, crimson pooling at his feet. The\u00A0Hellshire\u00A0Gang swarmed the warden, snapping bones with each kick.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWith the two men broken and begging for death, the posse dragged them to the commons\u00A0where they were\u00A0left to the growing crowd of prisoners.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESoaked in blood and sweat, Caleb hobbled to his old cell, hardly paying notice to Bayshore\u2019s screams. He sat on the bed\u2019s edge as drops of blood ran from his fingertips.\u00A0A thick, unnatural\u00A0fog\u00A0streamed through the barred window. He pulled out his old wrench, cracked and rusted, and ran a thumb along the metal, regarding it with faded eyes. He couldn\u2019t remember when it came into his possession. He didn\u2019t care to remember. At his feet he saw a dusty path, and, at its end, silhouettes of all who had done him wrong: the boys who bullied him, the executives who took advantage of him, and, again... Henry Bayshore. Emerging from a fog were the tools to dispose of them\u2014unforgiving steel hooks, brilliant and beautiful in their simplicity. Pain tore through his leg as he stood but he endured, pushing onward, walking the dusty path, leaving a trail of blood flowing behind him.\u00A0","tunables":{"TerrorRadius":3200,"MaxWalkSpeed":440,"ADS_Duration":0.4000000059604645,"ADS_Zoom":1.25,"ADS_Mouse_PitchScale_Multiplier":0.800000011920929,"ADS_Mouse_YawScale_Multiplier":0.4000000059604645,"ADS_Gamepad_PitchScale_Multiplier":0.8999999761581421,"ADS_Gamepad_YawScale_Multiplier":0.5,"ADS_RotationScale_AdjustmentTime":0.15000000596046448,"ADS_MovementSpeedMultiplier":0.8500000238418579,"Reload_Time":2.5999999046325684,"Reload_MovementSpeed_Multiplier":0.699999988079071,"Reload_RotationScale_Multiplier":0.5,"Reload_RotationScale_AdjustmentTime":0.5,"Harpoon_LaunchSpeed":4000,"Harpoon_LaunchDistanceFromCamera":75,"Chain_Length":1800,"Chain_Tension_MaxCharge":100,"Chain_Tension_BaseRate":2.5,"Chain_Tension_CollisionRate":20,"Chain_Tension_PullRate":15,"Chain_PullAngle":179,"Link_Elastic_Length":300,"Link_Maximum_Length":2000,"Link_Minimum_Length":175,"Link_Killer_BaseMovementSpeed_Multiplier":0.5,"Link_Killer_BackwardMovementSpeed_Multiplier":0.800000011920929,"Link_Killer_CollisionMovementSpeed_Multiplier":0.699999988079071,"Link_Killer_BackwardAngle":120,"Link_Survivor_BaseMovementSpeed_Multiplier":0.75,"Link_Survivor_CollisionMovementSpeed_Multiplier":0.6600000262260437,"Link_Survivor_ImmobilizationDuration":0.75,"Reel_Speed":276,"ReelBackSpeed":2500,"Fire_Duration":0.5,"Fire_MovementSpeed_Multiplier":0.5,"Fire_RotationScale_Multiplier":0.25,"Fire_RotationScale_AdjustmentTime":0.25,"Fire_LongRangeShotMinimumDistance":1200,"Fire_Miss_Duration":1.5,"Fire_Miss_MovementSpeed_Multiplier":0.5,"Fire_Success_Duration":0.5,"Fire_Success_MovementSpeed_Multiplier":0.5,"Fire_CrowActive_Range":2400,"Sight_MaximumSightDistance":1900,"Sight_MinimumScreenPercent":0.0001250000059371814,"Sight_MinimumVisiblePixelsPercent":0.009999999776482582,"Sight_ScreenZoneRadiusPercent":0.20000000298023224,"RifleStun_Duration":2.700000047683716,"RifleStun_RotationScale_Multiplier":0.20000000298023224,"RifleStun_RotationScale_AdjustmentTime":0.25,"IdleToAim_Duration":0.4000000059604645,"AimToIdle_Duration":0.6000000238418579},"item":"Item_Slasher_HarpoonRifle","outfit":["UkraineKiller_Head01","UkraineKiller_Body01","UkraineKiller_W01"],"dlc":"Ukraine","image":"UI/Icons/CharPortraits/Ukraine/K19_TheDeathslinger_Portrait.png","perks":["DeadMansSwitch","Gearhead","HexRetribution"]},"268435475":{"id":"K20","name":"The Executioner","role":"killer","difficulty":"veryhard","gender":"male","height":"tall","bio":"A map-manipulation Killer, able to torment Survivors with the hazards he creates.

This was the credo of Talbot Grimes, a Scottish chemist whose unrestrained ambition took him to towering heights. As a boy, he was a popular child\u2014bright, charismatic, and unafraid to challenge authority\u2014yet despite his social graces he was fiercely independent, spending much of his time exploring the sprawling fields near his town alone. What began as a child\u0027s curiosity nearly turned deadly after experimenting with a patch of poisonous foxglove. For days, he laid in bed dripping with sweat, purging any food that touched his stomach. When he recovered, it wasn\u0027t fear that gripped him, but fascination. There was something magical in how a single flower could so drastically affect him.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EInto his adult years, his ambition developed as quickly as his questionable methods. He attended the London School of Medicine and excelled despite several reprimands. His willingness to push the limits secured him a position with the British East India Company, and within seven years he was made head chemist. In time, he completed one of his greatest achievements: a chemical that could increase a worker\u0027s productivity while reducing their need for rest. He was rewarded with a secret laboratory beneath a prison camp on Dyer Island.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThere, off the coast of India, prisoners from the Opium War became his unwilling subjects, leading to a drug that allowed soldiers to withstand incredible amounts of pain. Though most side effects were minor, there were rumors that a small number of soldiers went mad. In feral states, they massacred villages, impaling the populace on bayonets, leaving them hanging from trees. There were no official reports on the subject, and Talbot refused to blame himself for what could only be exaggerated war stories.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThough his callous brilliance seemed unflappable, he was ignorant to the enemies his questionable work had amassed. The realization struck him quite literally\u2014with a steel pipe to the back of his head during a trip to Mangalore. He was bound and loaded into a wagon. When his blindfold was removed, a sickly man showed him a mass grave filled with hundreds of bodies. Unbeknownst to Talbot, his productivity-increasing drug had killed nearly an entire factory\u0027s worth of workers. He knew he couldn\u0027t defend himself against the anger and accusations of his abductor\u2014all he could do was curl up as the blows from the steel pipe rained down. His body was thrown into the grave and left for dead. Shifting between consciousness and the darkest black, he crawled for an escape, fingers sinking into rotting flesh. Black flies feasted on his uncovered skin, the sensation of a hundred pin pricks stabbing into him. As he collapsed, he came face to face with a dead woman\u2019s dazzling hazel eyes. Too weak to pull away, he could do nothing but witness his life\u2019s work.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThen, from the edge of death, he was brought back. He found himself on a small bed as a kindly, wrinkled face looked over him. With each pained breath, he was nursed back to health in an ancient mystery school posing as a monastery. In verdant gardens behind tall, unassuming walls, monks studied forbidden texts, striving to expand the human mind in the search for other dimensions\u2014believing one to be connected to the other.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETalbot\u2019s knowledge proved indispensable, his mind-altering chemicals integrating seamlessly with theories of neural expansion. He realized then that his salvation was no coincidence\u2014he was plucked from the pit specifically to advance the school\u2019s knowledge. He agreed to help until his recovery was complete, being tasked with researching what the monk\u2019s called the soul chemical, a compound derived from the pineal gland that could open the mind\u2019s eye. What began as a favor to his saviors, soon became an obsession. Poring over the school\u2019s archives of lost texts, he uncovered scientific formulas that confirmed previously unthinkable ideas. He dreamt of ushering humankind into a new period of enlightenment. Perhaps then, the nightmares of hundreds of dead factory workers\u2014and of those two hazel eyes\u2014would fade from his mind.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs he came closer to a breakthrough, the demeanor of the monks shifted. The gentle smiles they offered were paired with uneasy eyes that quickly darted away when spotted. The polite conversations he was once privy to turned to hushed murmurs. The last thing he would see of the school was the cracked ceiling above his bed, branching like a dendrite through plaster.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHis next memories were a shattered mosaic of images and sensations. Smearing lights, horse hoofs on cobblestone, coarse burlap scratching at his cheeks, and sharp bites into his arm. He awoke ragged and unwashed, splayed on the straw mattress of an opium den. Mind in a dense fog, his first thought was of his notes, the only record of his groundbreaking revelations. He searched frantically, scrambling through the dingy basement, pleading aloud for help. The few other denizens looked up from their hammocks, offering nothing but drug-soaked eyes and apathetic gazes that soon fell into half-slumber. Before he noticed the robed figure appear behind him, a needle plunged into his arm and the world disappeared once more.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAwoken. Again. Each time, hazier than the last. He tongued at hollow gaps between his teeth. How long, he wondered. A faint memory returned. The soul chemical. His notes. The verge of a breakthrough. A faraway whisper entered his mind.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHe fumbled with a stone, sharpening it with shaking hands. In the dim light of the den, amongst the catatonic occupants, he carved his research from memory into the walls. He wrote for hours until his fingers bled, moving to the floor, taking in everything the voice whispered despite his inability to comprehend it. When there was nowhere left to write, he gripped the stone and carved the message into his chest. Stained with blood, he witnessed a miracle appear before him\u2014a magnificent field of lush, orange flowers. The whispered voice beckoned to him, urging him to enter the field and discover worlds and dimensions beyond human comprehension. For a moment, Talbot felt the sense of wonder he possessed as a child.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe denizens of the opium den awoke to silence, the dry scent of smoke still lingering in the air.

The unlikeliness of their successful birth in the 17th century could be described as miraculous, yet it immediately brought about their life of persecution. The twins emerged with Victor\u2019s lower body affixed into the chest of his sister, legs twisted around her muscles and organs. He was smaller than Charlotte, grown as if he were an appendage of her body rather than a fully formed boy. As the newborns screeched, so too did the midwife who delivered them, running from the home, yelling of a demon birthed by a witch. So began the hunting of Charlotte, Victor, and their mother Madeleine.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe coming years were fleeting memories for the twins, yet they were the closest thing to a normal life they would know. The journey with their mother was what they believed all children underwent, the games of running and hiding through France\u2019s countryside being an ordinary occurrence. At the age of five, a new challenge to the game was presented as their mother fell ill. Pale and exhausted, Madeleine had no choice but to pass responsibility of collecting food onto Charlotte. The girl, burdened under extra clothing that concealed Victor\u2019s protruding body, set out from their forest tent and marched to the nearby town. Though a peculiar sight, she did what she had been trained for, waiting for an opening at the market and swiping whatever food she could. It was a victory in the game, but one short-lived.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter midnight, glowing flames surrounded the family\u2019s encampment, bobbing through the darkness. A single commanding shout broke the night\u2019s silence and a mob of witch hunters streamed in. Grubby hands tore the twins from their bed, Charlotte frantically kicking all who approached. Madeleine cried for her children, her voice abruptly silenced by a club to her skull. Victor shrieked, the wailings of a trapped rat.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe hunters coordinated quickly. A judge on hand declared Madeleine guilty of witchcraft, evidenced by her demon spawn. Within minutes, they shackled her unconscious body to a tree, surrounding her feet with dry twigs and moss. As she awoke, she did not struggle, only begged her children to turn away. They would be given no choice. The twins were forced to watch as the torch was lit, and they watched as flames leapt up their mother\u2019s skirt, charring and sizzling her flesh. They watched as fat dripped from her body, and her face bubbled and twisted. They watched until the screams that tore her vocal cords were no more, and all that was left was the crackling of embers and a nauseating stench.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhatever joy and goodness were in them died with their mother. Caged and transported to an old wooden temple, they were sold to a secretive group clad in dark cloaks. Victor reacted with the ferocity of a rabid beast at any who approached, clawing and biting. The only solace that could calm him was the embrace of his sister. Charlotte, bitter and hateful to all but her brother, found purpose in being his protector.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWithin the temple, they were exposed to unusual experiments for years\u2014some cruel, many simply baffling. One day they would be made to break the neck of a small grey bird. The next, they would bleed their fingers into a vase of roses. Every seventh day, they would sleep with the branch of a damp oak beneath their pillow. Then there was the chanting: a never-ending chorus from cloaked figures on scheduled intervals.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn time, a final experiment was planned. Two robed figures herded the twins to the center of the temple, holding Charlotte upon an altar in a room alit with candelabras. The wrinkled face of a man peered from under his hood, placing a hand on the forehead of each twin, making careful examination of their skulls. Memento mori, he uttered, as he withdrew a shining blade.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ECharlotte rolled to her side, shifting her brother off the altar. With a screech, he stretched his arm as far as he could, knocking a candelabra to the ground. The flames took to the dry wood immediately. They swept over the floor, igniting the black robes that brushed against it. Screams of agony pierced the chaos, invigorating Charlotte. She dashed through the inferno, vision concealed with nothing but black smoke and blazing flame. A painful heaviness filled her lungs. No exit could be found, every step leading to overwhelming heat. She fell to her knees, suffocating, and then saw it\u2014sunlight, trees. She stumbled from the fire into dewy grass. Without looking back, she ran into the forest until she collapsed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhen Charlotte opened her eyes, she reached for Victor\u2019s hand. He made no attempt to budge. His body hung helplessly from her torso. She clasped his face, stared into his sad, still eyes. The movements she was accustomed to\u2014his body pulling at her skin, his legs prodding at the cavity in her chest\u2014were no more. Victor was dead.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ECharlotte had no choice but to continue moving as she mourned, fearing black cloaks and witch hunters were prowling. She concealed her brother\u2019s corpse under her clothing and marched for the sewers of a nearby city. There, she set up camp, emerging often to steal whatever food she could, resorting to raiding barns for pig slop when desperation set in. Throughout the years, Victor\u2019s corpse rotted as his limbs oozed and blackened, yet his body demonstrated resistance to complete decomposition, as if his sister\u2019s blood still coursed through him. Protecting his lifeless body became Charlotte\u2019s sole reason for being, refusing to ever be separated from the only family she had left.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ELife in her teenage years was a game of survival. Her hatred for humanity grew each day under the realization they would never leave her be. No matter how many died during her botched robberies and desperate attempts to escape, there would always be more to pursue and sling words of condemnation at her\u2014monster, demon, witch. And it was the black cloaks who were the worst of them. Their hunt for her was unending, forcing her to constantly abandon shelter and run.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFor years, Charlotte fled, drawing blood out of necessity, cradling her long-dead brother in the night. During a frigid winter, her body began to break down. Food was scarce and the refuge of rickety shacks were no use against freezing temperatures. Sickle in hand, she sheltered near her campfire in the woods, not knowing if the black cloaks would take her before the cold did. As frost crystalized around her nostrils and her lips took on a gentle blue hue, Charlotte felt something she had never experienced: acceptance. She closed her eyes, opening herself to the serenity of death when\u2014a shriek, shrill and vicious pierced her ears. Victor spasmed and flailed from her chest, a cloud of fog encompassing him. Before she could react, he spilled from her in a bloody puddle, landing on the snow and running.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPulling herself from the edge of death, she gave chase. Calling his name, she ran through the forest until her legs could hardly carry her, until finally, within her view, was Victor, sitting at the edge of a thick fog. His face, twisted and feral, screamed as a dark hooded figure emerged from the fog, grabbed his arm, and seized him. The serenity that had crept into Charlotte was extinguished, replaced with the seething hatred and rage she had depended on for so long. With a tight grip on her sickle, she charged into the fog, prepared to eviscerate any who set foot near her brother.","tunables":{"MaxWalkSpeed":460,"CarryingCamperMaxWalkSpeedPercent":0.800000011920929,"Twin_MaxWalkSpeed":600,"TerrorRadius":3200,"TwinLullaby_AttachedRange":1400,"TwinLullaby_ControlledRange":1800,"TwinLullaby_DormantRange":1200,"HasteValueWhenVictorAttachedToSurvivor":0.10000000149011612,"KillerInstinct_AttachedLingerDuration":1.5,"KillerInstinct_DormantLingerDuration":1.5,"Power_MaxCharge":6,"Power_RechargeTime":6,"Power_RechargeTimeAfterTwinDestroyed":15,"Power_TimeBeforeAutoDestroyTwin":90,"Power_TimeBeforeRecallFromDormant":10,"Power_TimeBeforeRecallFromLockerAvailable":5,"Power_TimeBeforeRecallFromAttachedSurvivor":30,"TimeBeforeCollisionsDeactivation":30,"TwinEscapeBlocker_LingerDurationOnDowned":5,"ReleaseConjoinedTwin_ExitTime":0.75,"ReleaseConjoinedTwin_MaxCharge":0.02500000037252903,"PossessTheConjoinedTwin_ExitTime":0.25,"PossessNearHookDuration":5,"PossessTheConjoinedTwin_MaxCharge":0.07999999821186066,"PossessTheKiller_ExitTime":1.5,"PossessTheKiller_MaxCharge":0.07999999821186066,"HatchRestrictionRadius":600,"HookRestrictionRadius":1600,"BasementHookRestrictionSphericalRadius":1600,"ExitGateRestrictionRadius":400,"ChargeJump_CancelCooldown":0.25,"ChargeJump_MaxCharge":0.8500000238418579,"ChargeJump_MaxCameraPitch":10,"InspectEmptyLocker_InteractionTime":3,"InspectOccupiedLocker_InteractionTime":2,"TwinAura_OnAttachedToSurvivorRevealDuration":5,"TwinJump_AuthorizedLandingHeight":80,"TwinJump_StartVelocity":2835,"TwinJump_GravityScale":3.75,"TwinJump_MissCooldownTime":3,"TwinJump_SucceedAttachedCooldownTime":1,"TwinJump_SucceedNotAttachedCooldownTime":2.700000047683716,"TwinJump_ObstructedCooldownTime":3,"TwinJump_UpDownObstructionAnglePrecision":6,"TwinJump_LeftRightObstructionAnglePrecision":66,"DestroyTwin_MaxCharge":0.3499999940395355,"RemoveTwin_MaxCharge":10,"RemoveTwin_ExitTime":1,"LoudNoiseRange_ClosetFakeEnter":4800,"PushTwinOnLocker_MaxCharge":10},"item":"Item_Slasher_K22Power","outfit":["K22_Head01","K22_Body01","K22_Weapon01"],"dlc":"Aurora","image":"UI/Icons/CharPortraits/Aurora/K22_TheTwins_Portrait.png","perks":["K22P01","K22P02","K22P03"]},"268435478":{"id":"K23","name":"The Trickster","role":"killer","difficulty":"intermediate","gender":"male","height":"average","bio":"A ranged Killer, able to quickly unleash a flurry of blades by using\u00A0his\u00A0power,\u00A0\u003Cb\u003EShowstopper\u003C/b\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHis\u00A0personal perks, \u003Cb\u003EStarstruck\u003C/b\u003E, \u003Cb\u003EHex: Crowd Control\u003C/b\u003E, and \u003Cb\u003ENo Way Out\u003C/b\u003E, allow him\u00A0to quickly down would-be rescuers and block areas of the environment to his advantage.","story":"Ji-Woon Hak thrived under the attention of others, energized by every eye that watched him and every tongue that spoke his name. Amidst the prestige, he had only one desire: more. Even as a child he found ways to draw crowds. Working at his family\u2019s restaurant, he attracted business with spectacles he performed using throwing knives. Gullible tourists believed this was a traditional South Korean experience, gladly parting with their money to witness it. Ji-Woon\u0027s father spent the restaurant\u2019s earnings on dancing and vocal lessons for his son, pushing him to attain the fame he never could.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EJi-Woon did not disappoint. After years showcasing his abilities to nobodies at talent shows, he hit the track to stardom. Yun-Jin Lee, a producer at Mightee One Entertainment, recruited Ji-Woon into her training program. He transferred to a dormitory in Seoul where, for fourteen hours a day, he was crafted into a star, taught how to move and sing, how to carry himself with the right balance of confidence and modesty.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EDraining as the process was, it worked. Yun-Jin selected Ji-Woon to join the band NO SPIN, bringing a raw energy to their tracks. Fame was almost immediate. Ji-Woon lived in a daze of interviews and adoration, and though the frenzied schedule exhausted his bandmates, he was invigorated. Each day was an affirmation that he was greater than the mediocrity society spewed out.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBut over time, the champagne grew stale. When he looked at his fans, he saw their joy and envy split five ways, thinned out between each band member. The validation that had surged through him left a desperate yearning for more.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EJi-Woon kept up impressions, mimicking a charm long buried under loathing. He recorded the latest NO SPIN album with his bandmates, never missing a beat. After a lengthy lunch break, he returned to the studio to discover fate had granted him a gift. The scent of burning wires was unmistakable. He rushed to the control room, finding the door blocked by fallen speakers. On the other side, his bandmates pounded on the door, their cries accompanied by the crackling of flames.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EJi-Woon called to them, dashing to the speakers, grabbing one and\u2014stopping. He froze. Each breath was a conscious, deliberate process requiring all his attention, the nearby cries hardly audible until, slowly, he backed away. And then he heard it. They were screaming his name as they burnt. Screaming for him to save them. Ji-Woon! Ji-Woon! Ji-Woon Hak! It was the most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever heard. When the fire crew arrived, his tears were genuine.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EJi-Woon was celebrated as a tragic figure, a hero who did all he could in a futile attempt to save his friends. Yun-Jin paraded him through interviews until it was time to rebrand. He was reborn as The Trickster, a solo artist who produced his own songs, sporting a soft heart beneath a wild exterior. But, away from concert set-ups and television stages, something darker grew.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHe targeted those who lived alone, coming to them in the night. The first was a college music student with a captivating voice. Ji-Woon woke him with a baseball bat to the skull, binding his arms and legs, gagging him with a rag duct taped into his mouth. He tortured him for hours, dissecting him alive. Yet there was something missing\u2014a sound, a connection. He wanted to hear the victim\u2019s wonderous voice pleading as he cut his belly open, but all he received was muffled cries through a rag.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHe learned and adjusted.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EVictims had to be abducted, driven to an abandoned building where he could let their voices carry unrestrained emotion. He made music from them, prodding in the right places to evoke different types of shrieks and howls. Stabbing the quadratus lumborum elicited a long, guttural wail, while slashing the carotid artery created a sound similar to a cat being strangled. There was honesty in their suffering. Ji-Woon recorded each session, synthesizing and working them into his songs, hiding them behind layers of melodies.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHe was elated with his work. He left hints for police, arranging a mink boa from a recent photoshoot around a victim\u2019s slashed throat. For his next killing, he removed the teeth from a man that a boxer in one of his music videos was without. During a particularly audacious plea for attention, he killed a fan he had met during a VIP meet-up, replacing her eyes with his diamond cufflinks and writing I HAVE SEEN GOD in blood across her chest. Each scene was a dazzling spectacle.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBetween music and murder, Ji-Woon\u2019s work was discussed globally. However, as violence became his preferred art style, his music career took a hit. Revenue was down and Mightee One executives pointed their fingers at him. Yun-Jin, with professional fury, came to his defense, but she was outnumbered. It was decided that Ji-Woon could no longer self-produce his songs.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe decision was devastating. His tracks fused genuine humanity into music, yet executives rejected anything that wasn\u2019t generic and expected. And so be it. If they couldn\u2019t understand his art, he would incorporate them into it until they did.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHe had three months until he was to perform a private show for Mightee One\u2019s board members; three months to plan his magnum opus. He transferred obscene amounts of money to a veterinarian in exchange for cannisters of nitrous oxide, then bribed the stage technician of Mightee One\u2019s private theatre for access to the room. His celebrity granted him a benefit of the doubt no regular person could conceive. When the show was ready, gas seeped into the room as executives and stagehands awaited Ji-Woon, conveniently running behind schedule.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhen he arrived, half-conscious bodies were splayed in their seats and crawling across the floor. He worked quickly, binding everyone, pausing only when he came to Yun-Jin\u2014the woman who had plucked him from a mudhole and set him on the path he deserved. She would be rewarded, granted special access to the coming display of wonder. Even under sedation, she fought, a raging storm within her, far stronger than the others. He propped her up as the lone audience member, prying her eyes open. The others, sniveling and sobbing, were brought on stage to perform their final act. With a contemptable sneer, he slapped makeup onto their faces and shone stage lights upon them. They became his instruments.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETo the sound of self-produced melodies, he tortured them, gracefully dashing from one body to another, conducting an operatic crescendo from their wailings. They shouted, whimpered, screamed, cried for their loved ones, cried for their mothers. It was a magnificent outpouring of emotion, of what it meant to be human, and they did it with eyes fixed on Ji-Woon.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EViscera drained from the stage until, with the toss of his throwing knife, the final human instrument fell silent and the music stopped. Covered in sweat and blood, an exhausted Ji-Woon looked to Yun-Jin and bowed. Curtain call. He had attained perfection. With blade in hand, he made his way to Yun-Jin, prepared to tie up loose ends before the credits rolled. But as he reached her\u2014\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe Fog.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFrom where, he didn\u2019t know, but it billowed around them, damp, cool... comfortable. He saw the grand stage: hospitals and temples, forests and slaughterhouses\u2014an eternal plane adorned with rusted hooks, sustained by the million eyes that would watch him, run from him, \u003Ci\u003Eexperience him\u003C/i\u003E.

Growing up a rugged coastal village in southern Chile, she sketched the sublime landscapes of Patagonia. Sitting outside, she painted dramatic fjords while feeding the crows nested in the tree next to the house.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EShe grew up carrying the guilt of her mother\u0027s sudden departure. Her father blamed Carmina for her mother\u0027s abandonment, which added to her grief. She became the caretaker of Matias, her little brother, despite still being a child herself.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EA year later, Carmina was painting with Matias outside when the telephone rang. Her father remained in the yard, drinking his beer. Carmina rushed to the house to answer the phone and hung up a few seconds later. When she returned outside, Matias was nowhere to be seen. She asked her father, but he had paid no attention to Matias. She called her brother\u0027s name, looking for him everywhere. While searching, she saw a bright red coat floating on the narrow creek by the house--Matias\u0027 jacket. She jumped into the creek and found him floating on the surface with vacant eyes, unblinking. He had fallen and drowned.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHer scream tore the sky. Her father found Carmina sobbing on the creek\u0027s shore, clutching her brother\u0027s body in her arms, surrounded by a murder of crows. Her father snatched Matias\u0027s body away from her, and she cried until her voice broke.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe following morning, the world was cloaked in darkness. Her father did not say a word, because he did not have to. Carmina knew it was all her fault. Months passed, yet her loss was as fresh as morning dew. Crippled with self-loathing, she could no longer paint. Without Matias, life had no meaning.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOn the bleak morning of Matias\u2019s birthday, Carmina walked to a narrow bridge several blocks away from home. She was convinced that nothing could bring her relief. Her mother was gone, her brother was dead, and her father blamed her for it all. She was convinced that she had nothing left to live for.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ECarmina walked to the railing of the bridge that stood over the turbulent river. Locals had nicknamed the spot DeathLeap. Several cars drove by Carmina, but none stopped. No one seemed to care. She climbed over the railing and her legs wobbled as she stood on the lip of the bridge. She looked down, watching the fierce river smash into a giant boulder. She closed her eyes.\u003Ci\u003ESee you soon, Matias.\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESuddenly, a cacophony of caws filled the sky. Carmina opened her eyes and saw a black cloud of feathers flying toward her. The cloud split open and glossy black crows dove from the sky. One landed on her shoulder and stared intently into Carmina\u2019s eyes, as if peering into her soul. Her grip on the railing loosened and the crow cawed raucously. Carmina stared at the crow, confused.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAnother crow landed on the railing, then another. Soon, a flock of crows were covering the railing of the bridge, staying close to her. She felt their heavy stare on her, calculative and enigmatic, as if they were assessing her. She looked down for a second and a thunder of caws interrupted her dark impulse. The crows seemed to care about her wellbeing. As she dangled over the edge with the wind blowing through her raven hair, Carmina felt akin to them. For the first time since Matias had died, Carmina did not feel alone.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EShe returned home, giving life another chance. The crows left but Carmina suspected that if anything happened to her, they would return.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EInspired by her ordeal, Carmina picked up a brush. In the weeks that followed, she painted her experience, using black ink to depict the DeathLeap with a black cloud of feathers, the murder of crows that saved her life. The experience was transformative and launched her signature, black-ink surrealist art.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter several years, some color pierced the darkness, and this shift of medium expanded her art form. She painted large-scale murals on busy street corners, designed grandiose costumes, and recited militant poetry. Carmina\u2019s art displayed local, intimate tragedies on a large scale, making them impossible to ignore. And everywhere she performed, crows followed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHer performances grew bold and drew the attention of artists who found her style invigorating. She grew close to a group of painters who understood her iconoclastic vision. Her performances launched the Large-Scale Surrealist movement, which became a phenomenon.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHer renown grew enough to attract the commission of a multinational enterprise, The Vack Label. Carmina investigated the group, discovering that they gifted art pieces to select disreputable congressmen. Vack\u2019s commissioned artists seemed to disappear afterward.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EDetermined to expose the group\u0027s link to corrupt politics, Carmina accepted Vack\u0027s commission. The following week, Carmina painted a giant mural on a cemetery\u0027s columbarium, displaying the Vack Label logo as a surrealist grim reaper harvesting the fields of Chilean families. She wore a theatrical dress as she painted, on which she had stitched a poem about political revolution.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe piece sparked a radical debate about corruption. The controversy painted a target on Carmina\u0027s back. After receiving anonymous death threats, she took refuge in her father\u2019s house, bringing along her closest friends for safety.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThat night, a gang of masked gunmen broke into the house. They swiftly subdued Carmina and her friends, threw them in a van, and drove off.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe following morning, a dry breeze blew sand on Carmina\u0027s face, awakening her. She was seated in a chair in the middle of the desert, with her legs tied and her hands handcuffed. Her friends were lying on the ground, tied up. A shadow fell over her face. Carmina looked up.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EA man dressed in a long robe with his face hidden in a dark hood approached her. He pulled a silvery knife from his robe.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHe grabbed her hands and recited a hymn in an unfamiliar language. Carmina held his gaze. He paused and brought down his blade with a sudden blow.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EShe cried in agony as her friends woke to a terrible sight; Carmina\u0027s severed hands falling in the sand.The handcuffs followed, landing into a pool of blood\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe hooded man smiled in satisfaction. \u003Ci\u003EHow are you going to paint now?\u003C/i\u003E Carmina cursed and screamed at him, wriggling against the bonds on her legs.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe man grabbed Carmina\u2019s chin. She spit in his face.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHe grunted and pried her mouth open, pulling out her tongue. Carmina struggled against his hold. In a violent blow, he chopped off Carmina\u0027s tongue.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EShe howled in anguish. The man wiped his blade on his robe, leaving a trail of blood. \u003Ci\u003EHow are you going to recite poems now?\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESorrow swelled in Carmina\u0027s chest, sharper than pain. Overwhelmed by uncontrollable rage, grief and loss overcame her senses. She had lost her little brother. And she had lost the only way to cope with such pain. Carmina screamed like on the day her brother died.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ERaucous caws echoed through the wasteland. The sky was obscured by a cyclone of dark clouds. Black feathers fell on Carmina\u0027s bleeding arms. She looked up and saw a torrent of crows erupting from the clouds, diving on the hooded man.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs the ravenous crows pecked at his flesh mercilessly, Carmina smiled, watching her Surrealist art coming to life.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBut her heart lurched with rage when she saw the crows move on to their next target, her friends on the ground. She screamed as waves of pain, guilt, and fright overwhelmed her. But it was in vain, the ravenous crows were uncontrollable.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EDarkness fell over her eyes as her friends\u0027 agonizing screams grew more acute.

When a journalist called her mother a fraud, Sadako\u2019s powers surged, and the journalist collapsed on the floor, struck dead.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThen everything went wrong. Her mother passed away and shortly after Sadako was lured to an old, crumbling well. As she leaned over the rim, a long shadow fell over her. She turned and a sudden jolt of pain hit her over the head, cracking it open. Her vision dimmed and her mind swirled into unconsciousness. She felt two hands pushing her over the rim.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPain exploded in her skull as she hit the cold ground.

Looking up, she saw the only way out. She dug her nails into the muddy ground and slowly crawled toward the cobbled wall. She gripped the stones to climb but had neither hold nor strength. Each time she clawed up a few inches, her nails slid against the wet wall and she slipped down. Her fingers gushed with blood as the coarse cobblestone tore off her nails and lacerated the flesh underneath. And yet she tried, again and again.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EDecades later, the meadow became a resort, and a log cabin was built above the well.

He spoke of an ancient god called, Druanee, telling them how this god fed on dark memories and desires and how they needed to expel any and all manifestations of darkness from their hearts for fear of summoning this horror from the Land of Shadows.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ELife was more or less a Utopian dream on the island until, that is, the darkness began to slowly leak through the cracks of their spiritual dam and members began to mysteriously disappear.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIt wasn\u2019t long before fear closed its septic jaws on the island and refused to let go.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe once happy community now gathered in a few homes chanting all the \u2018good-thinking\u2019 mantras in a desperate attempt to rid their lives of this formless creature that seemed to stalk them in the shadows and consume them in their sleep.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOtto tried to quell his followers, telling them that there were malcontents among their ranks and that they alone had summoned the Druanee to their Garden of Joy.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs The Fold bleated fear, Otto evoked desperate measures. Ottomarians were restricted to their homes to prevent the spread of rumors and dark-talk while sleep was forbidden to prevent anyone from releasing dark dreams into the world. Freedom and sleep would return just as soon as the Druanee was no longer upon them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBut when Ottomarians continued to disappear, Otto assembled his followers near the beach where he placed a screaming woman on a wooden stage. There, in the rain, Otto explained to his drenched, alienated, and sleep-deprived congregation that the woman was a journalist here to destroy everything they had created.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs the guardians held the trembling woman, she screamed that Otto wasn\u2019t the savior he claimed to be. He belonged to an ancient cult, an exclusive club of billionaires that took pleasure in corrupting and sacrificing people, towns and even countries to an Elder God. The journalist told them Otto hadn\u0027t banished anyone! He had tortured and sacrificed them and that they would all be next.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWithout hesitation, Otto slit her throat before she could continue to spread lies. As she collapsed to her knees with her hands clasped around her neck, he told his confused and terrified herd that she was working with others within their ranks and that they needed to find the impostors before the Druanee came for them all.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOtto\u2019s words shot over the congregation and reached into the murky recesses of their hearts and dredged up dark and fearful things.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EYears of suppressed emotions began to bubble up as a thick fog pushed through restless legs and feet. Whispers began, and the whispers became panicked mantras, and the mantras became screams and curses as each member accused the next of malthinking and malspeaking.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOver the howling wind and pounding rain, the screams and curses grew louder and louder as everyone desperately tried to contain the darkness within. But the harder they tried, the quicker they failed, and within moments the dam burst to release a torrent of hell.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOtto watched his once blissful and joyful herd suddenly erupt into violence unlike anything he had ever seen before. The Fold bleated accusations and tore each other to bits and pieces with hands and teeth and never once did they look up to see their kind and charismatic shepherd smiling down upon them with eyes that were cold, bleak and without pity.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhen it was all over, Otto felt the creaking, wooden stage shake as a murder of crows circled above. Suddenly, the ground rose and then sank into a thick, oozing black mud like molasses. Moments later, a formless mass squelched out of the muck and rose like a rearing horse to feed upon the writhing mass of butchered humanity.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIt was everywhere and nowhere at once as it slowly picked its way through the carnage, absorbing the darkness, savoring the misery, trailing terrible noises. Shrieks. Cries. Whimpers. Pops. Cracks.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFeasting sounds.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EDeath sounds.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EDark sounds.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOtto watched the creature as it slowly began to manifest into the very thing he had imagined--the very thing he had made them all imagine.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIt turned slowly to look at Otto for a long silent moment, then the Druanee trudged away through the thick black sludge, disappearing into the shadows from which it had come.","tunables":{"MaxWalkSpeed":460,"CarryingCamperMaxWalkSpeedPercent":0.800000011920929,"TerrorRadius":3200,"MaxTrackedTimeSinceLockerOrRemnantExit":3,"K28Power_PowerChargeTime_InitialChargeTime":12,"K28Power_PowerChargeTime_DayCycle":12,"K28Power_PowerChargeTime_NightCycle":4,"K28Power_ChargedState_NumberOfTokens":3,"DayNight_NightCharging_RequiredChargesForCompletion":300,"DayNight_NightCharging_ChargeAmount_KillerHidingInLocker":6,"DayNight_NightCharging_ChargeAmount_InjuredSurvivor":0.75,"DayNight_NightCharging_ChargeAmount_Default":0.25,"DayNight_NightCharging_ChargeAmount_GameEvent_InjureSurvivorViaAttack":20,"DayNight_NightCharging_ChargeAmount_GameEvent_HookSurvivor":20,"DayNight_NightCharging_ChargeAmount_KillerTeleportsToRemnant":10,"DayNight_NightCharging_NearingActivationThresholdPercent":0.8500000238418579,"DayNight_NightDischarging_ReachedNearEndThresholdPercent":0.6600000262260437,"DayNight_NightDischarging_RequiredChargesForCompletion":60,"DayNight_NightDischarging_BaseDischargeRate":1,"DayNight_NightTransitionTime":3,"DayNight_DayTransitionTime":1.5,"DayNight_SurvivorSeeOtherSurvivorVFXMinimumDistance":100,"DayNight_SurvivorSeeOtherSurvivorVFXMaximumDistance":4000,"DayNight_KillerSeeSurvivorVFXMinimumDistance":10,"DayNight_KillerSeeSurvivorVFXMaximumDistance":4000,"DayNight_NightCycle_VisibilityMaximumDistance":4000,"DayNight_DarknessRadiusDistance":1800,"DayNight_Killer_OtherPlayerMaxViewDistance":7000,"DayNight_Survivor_OtherPlayerMaxViewDistance":5000,"DayNight_Killer_BlackMaterialMinDistance":2200,"TeleportInteraction_ChargeTime":0.5,"TeleportInteraction_Speed_DayCycle":1200,"TeleportInteraction_Speed_NightCycle":3800,"TeleportInteraction_RemnantFadeInTime":0.25,"TeleportInteraction_RemnantFadeOutTime":0.25,"TeleportInteraction_SurvivorGrab_Duration":3,"TeleportInteraction_MinDistanceFromHookedSurvivor":1200,"TeleportInteraction_MinDistanceFromLocker":300,"ExitLockedLockerInteraction_Time":3,"Locker_FOV":120,"Locker_KillerInstinctRadius":1600,"Locker_TimeToTriggerWarningReveal":8,"Locker_KillerInstinctLingerDuration":3,"Locker_PreventSearchInteractionTime":1.25},"item":"Item_Slasher_K28Power","outfit":["K28_Head01","K28_Body01","K28_Weapon01"],"dlc":"Meteor","image":"UI/Icons/CharPortraits/Meteor/K28_TheDredge_Portrait.png","perks":["K28P01","K28P02","K28P03"]},"268435484":{"id":"K29","name":"The Mastermind","role":"killer","difficulty":"intermediate","gender":"male","height":"average","bio":"Albert Wesker is a brilliant and ruthless mastermind infused with the power of Uroboros.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHis personal perks, \u003Cb\u003ESuperior Anatomy\u003C/b\u003E, \u003Cb\u003EAwakened Awareness\u003C/b\u003E, and \u003Cb\u003ETerminus\u003C/b\u003E allow you to vault faster, see other Survivor\u0027s auras while carrying one, and cause Survivors to be permanently Broken when the exit gates are powered.","story":"Albert Wesker was a high-ranking official in the Umbrella Corporation.

He remembered the cries and screams in the village. He remembered his mother forcing him to swallow a thick, black fluid like medicine. He remembered collapsing to the hard floor only to awaken in a mass grave, buried under a crush of bodies, with the sound of the village burning in his ears. He remembered pushing, pulling, and climbing to the top of the bloody mass only to be seized by the death, destruction, and silence\u2014the indifferent and impenetrable silence. A high-pitched whine suddenly sounded in his ears and his skin began to prickle as he realized he was in the presence of something he couldn\u2019t possibly understand. And though he couldn\u2019t articulate what he was experiencing, he knew it wasn\u2019t pain, grief, or fear. It was something else. Something closer to\u2014\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAwe.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs Tarhos tried to make sense of the moment, he didn\u2019t notice the men who approached him from behind. He didn\u2019t even react when they carried him off to a horse-drawn buggy and locked him up in a small, wooden cage with other slaves. He just stared at the scene, mesmerized. And even as they rode away telling him he was headed for Italy, Tarhos stared through the wooden cracks with eyes wide open and a heart wanting to understand what could not be understood.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFrom that day on, Tarhos belonged to the Guardia Compagnia where he trained under Kadir Hakam. There he learned to wield weapons, forge armor, and recite a code of chivalry to obediently serve those who would employ his services. As the years passed, Tarhos made few friends amongst the hostile and competitive mercenaries. But his skill, strength, and smarts attracted a small following who believed his courage brought them luck in battle and that one day he would help them earn their collective freedom. Three of his followers pledged their undying allegiance to Tarhos and came to be known as his faithful three. His pack.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAlejandro Santiago apprenticed with the Guardia Compagnia\u2019s armorer.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EDurkos Malecek showed an aptitude for stealth and silent kills.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESander Rault matched Tarhos in size and strength. His weapon of choice: a massive battle axe.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs the Guardia Compagnia carried out campaigns in faraway lands, Tarhos dispatched countless enemies. Years passed. Blood flowed. And yet, all that killing still didn\u2019t bring Tarhos closer to what he had experienced in his village. Nevertheless, for his bravery in battle, Tarhos was granted knighthood and freedom. The Hungarian slave was now liberated, his brutality rewarded, though his heart still longed for something else\u2014something he could not name or describe. Tired of taking orders from those he considered his inferiors, Tarhos left the Guardia Compagnia to strike out on his own. Their leader, however, refused to release his followers.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EDetermined to raise enough gold to liberate his followers, Tarhos found employment with a wealthy Italian Lord. Vittorio Toscano was the Duke of Portoscuro. He was also a scholar, a world traveler, and a collector of ancient knowledge that had been hidden by an unknown cabal of mystics. Tarhos joined Vittorio\u2019s latest expedition to find a fragment of a pillar from an ancient school lost to time. A stone Vittorio called the Lapis Paradisus for he believed it held secrets to open a gateway into a perfect world beyond good and evil.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe expedition searched Roman ruins in France and crossed the Pyrenees Mountains into Spain where the path led to the catacombs beneath the Portuguese city of Sintra.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe citizens there considered the catacombs sacred. Tarhos would have to kill the villagers guarding the entrance to retrieve the stone. Not wanting to shed blood, Vittorio commanded Tarhos to find another way. But Tarhos\u2014who had seen the most horrific acts committed under the guise of chivalry\u2014refused to be dissuaded by pretenses of honor. He waited for Vittorio to ride back to camp. Then, with a mighty roar, he pushed forward, cutting a path of blood and gore into the darkness until he had the stone in his grasp.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EUpon returning to the town of Portoscuro, Tarhos imprisoned Vittorio in his own dungeon, demanding to know the meaning behind the symbols etched in the stone. When Vittorio refused to talk, Tarhos brutally tortured his friends and relatives and made horrific displays of their bodies in the streets. But nothing he did shook Vittorio\u2019s resolve to keep the secrets of the stone from Tarhos. Enraged, Tarhos seized control of Vittorio\u2019s riches and raised a small army. Within months, Tarhos fearlessly marched upon the Guardia Compagnia, decimating their barracks, freeing his followers, cutting down his enemies like twigs and collecting their \u2018righteous\u2019 heads for his growing displays of \u2018valor.\u2019\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn time several lords in neighboring provinces believed Tarhos was the very embodiment of evil. They banded together to create a \u2018moral\u2019 and \u2018virtuous\u2019 army to purge evil from Portoscuro. Tarhos ignored their threats. He viewed the lords as a cowardly lot who cloaked their greed and ambition in laws, codes, and platitudes. Laws and codes and platitudes designed to hide from the very darkness Tarhos embraced and accepted without judgment.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBut, with his enemies on the march, Tarhos headed toward the dungeons to give Vittorio the death he deserved. He refused to afford him even the slightest hope of rescue. With dark intentions, he entered the small prison, wound his way into the bowels of the earth, and pushed through a torch-lit corridor. He hesitated for a moment, realizing he would never learn Vittorio\u2019s knowledge and secrets. But neither would anyone else. That was good enough for him. And so, he unlocked and kicked open the dungeon door. Two quick strides brought him to an empty, rat-infested chamber.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETarhos stood silent for a moment, then a roar of indignation burst out of his lungs as the sounds of battle suddenly reverberated through the town. Instantly, he stumbled through the corridor, rushed up the twisting stairs, vaulted out of the moonlit doorway and charged through pools of gleaming blood and viscera, smashing and shattering his way through the enemy. The \u2018moral\u2019 and \u2018virtuous\u2019 lords rained flaming boulders and tree-trunks among the town, bursting through homes, crushing villagers like worms, pounding the ground and igniting stacks of hay and piles of lumber into massive tongues of fire.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAmidst the carnage and chaos, the pack found Tarhos, and back-to-back, they became a whirlwind of death. Some believed their courage gave them luck. Others believed something otherworldly protected them. Whatever it was, they alone felled dozens of warriors as easily as stomping and crushing beetles. And as they butchered the enemy, Tarhos didn\u2019t notice the strange fog rising from the fallen corpses and clattering armor until he couldn\u2019t see two inches in front of him in any direction.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETarhos stumbled forward, groping in the thick fog like the dark fluid his mother forced down his throat all those years ago. His coordination and sense of direction was confused as he called out for his pack. How long he stumbled in the almost perfect darkness he did not know. But suddenly the fog dissipated to reveal a fantasmal wasteland of rotting bodies and burning villages and great crumbling towers leaning drunkenly on the horizon. He stared in awe. A familiar high-pitched whine sounded in his ears and his skin began to prickle. He stood transfixed, realizing by some incredible chance, his heart had found exactly what it had been searching for all his life. He didn\u2019t need Vittorio. He didn\u2019t need the stone. He had found his paradise. He had found\u2014\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe beauty and the horror.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHe had found\u2014\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe Sublime.","tunables":{"MaxWalkSpeed":460,"CarryingCamperMaxWalkSpeedPercent":0.800000011920929,"TerrorRadius":3200,"MinimumPathDistanceRequirement":1000,"PreviewSnappingTime":0.30000001192092896,"DrawPathInteractionChargeTime":0.009999999776482582,"DrawPathFOVModifier":25,"OrderTargetingMaximumDistance":600,"MaxPathLength":3200,"MaximumDistanceBetweenPathNodes":500,"MinimumDistanceBetweenPathNodes":200,"PathLengthPercentLimitForAudioWarning":0.699999988079071,"PathDrawingDurationLimitAudioWarningPercent":0.699999988079071,"MinSlopeToCheckStepUp":20,"TransitionSpeedWhenKillerLookInFrontOfHim":1,"TransitionTimeWhenKillerIsLaunchToPreviewPosition":1,"DrawPathMode_YawInputLimit":290,"CameraPushedDistance":80,"FloatingCameraMaxSpeed":1380,"FloatingCameraAccelerationMultiplier":1,"Guard1Cooldown":10,"Guard2Cooldown":10,"Guard3Cooldown":10,"PathDrawingMaximumDuration":10,"KillerPostPowerHasteValue":0.05000000074505806,"FlagPickUpEnduranceEffectDuration":3,"FlagPickUpHasteEffectDuration":3,"FlagPickUpHasteSpeedModifier":0.5,"StrafeMovementSpeedMultiplier":0.25,"PathCreationModeOverFadeInTime":0.3499999940395355},"item":"Item_Slasher_K30Power","outfit":["K30_Head01","K30_Body01","K30_Weapon01"],"dlc":"Quantum","image":"UI/Icons/CharPortraits/Quantum/K30_TheKnight_Portrait.png","perks":["K30P01","K30P02","K30P03"]},"268435486":{"id":"K31","name":"The Skull Merchant","role":"killer","difficulty":"hard","gender":"female","height":"average","bio":"The Skull Merchant is a tactical Killer, able to place Drones that detect and debilitate her targets.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHer personal perks, \u003Cb\u003EGame Afoot\u003C/b\u003E, \u003Cb\u003ETHWACK!\u003C/b\u003E, and \u003Cb\u003ELeverage\u003C/b\u003E allow her to gain Haste from pursuing your Obsession, force screams from Survivors when breaking walls or pallets, and reduce Survivors\u0027 heal speed the more times you place them on hooks.","story":"The self-made millionaire Adriana Imai came from a humble home in Fortaleza, Brazil.

A talented illustrator, he spent his spare time designing colorful characters and worlds.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhile sketching patrons of a local jazz club, he was approached by Belinda, the owner, to work on a logo. What began as a business partnership soon became a romantic one, and within a couple of years, Adriana was born.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAdriana excelled in all facets of education. A house full of art and music honed a brilliant mind, and her intelligence was only exceeded by her obsessive drive to be the best.

Despite working long hours at a canning facility and writing his manga in his spare time, he somehow managed a little time every night to share his wild and highly imaginative illustrations with his daughter.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy middle school, Adriana was courted by a fancy private school due to her high performance, and, needing money, Seita spoke to publishers about his unpublished manuscripts. He managed to find a small local publisher to carry \u003Ci\u003EAdi Valente\u003C/i\u003E, but it meant more work than he could handle. He eventually lost his job at the cannery, giving him more time to develop and illustrate his series.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAdriana loved the manga, but the family was forced into hard times.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn her final semester, Seita requested higher royalties, but the publishing company went into administration and decided to cut the series. No longer able to afford the school fees, Adriana was pulled out of the elite academy where she was at the top of her class. Belinda was able to negotiate her graduation, but another student was able to take her place at the head of the class. Adriana was furious. On summer break, she learned everything about her rival: where he lived, where he hung out, what he liked to do in his spare time, what he listened to, what he watched, everything. She even stalked him on his way home one late summer evening and considered the myriad ways she could ruin his life. But, in the end, she did nothing, though something awakened within her and she felt like the anti-hero in a new story her father had been exploring.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESeita retreated further into himself and began producing this newer, darker manga, inspired by his visions and nightmares.

By the age of 18, barely with a high school degree, she had already become a self-made millionaire. As stories of this investment wunderkind spread across Brazil, more and more doors opened for her.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBefore long, she had the kind of money that allowed her to buy small companies\u2014companies that she would gut, replace with non-union workers, and sell at a profit. The only breaks she took from her corporate obsession was to pore over her father\u2019s manuscripts, trying to understand this chilling world he had created.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBy her mid 20\u2019s, she was regularly flipping companies. While finalizing on a real estate firm, two members of the board moved to block the sale, pointing to the trail of hollowed-out husks she left in her wake. Adriana was frustrated. It took her weeks to find out who the holdouts were, but once she did, she thought about how it would feel to hurt them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EShe learned everything about the directors. Stalked their every move. Manipulated them into attending a conference in Switzerland. And, while on retreat in the Alps, she made her move. Inspired by The Skull Merchant, and feeling something within demanding expression, she tracked them with a prototype drone, and brutally dismembered them with a cruel two-bladed weapon. The rush of emotion and adrenaline was unlike anything she had ever experience before. And the company was hers!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThus began an unsettling cycle. Swoop in on a business, destroy anyone standing in her way, and gut the company for maximum profit. She targeted companies with larger-than-life CEOs and hoped one would present a challenge. None ever did. They just \u2018disappeared\u2019 unremarkably.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAn aggressive manager of a fireworks company, known for his \u201Csurvival tours,\u201D was her last target, right at home in Brazil.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESurvival tours\u2026 a perfect cover.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAdriana lured him to a decommissioned airship hangar.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe hunt started at dawn and went the distance, with her still tracking him well into the evening. Locating him, she used one of her drones to direct him to a dead end, when a pair of kites suddenly appeared on camera, and the feed died. Her face hardened. Her eyes widened in disbelief as she slammed her laptop shut and charged to where the drone had crashed. There she found her prey reaching out to someone in the growing dark for help.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWitnesses.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENot part of the plan!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWithout a second to lose, she plunged her blade through his stomach, exposing meat, bone, and a dying heart. The vitiated body staggered left and right, sending a shower of red over the green foliage. As her victim collapsed with a thud she turned to the young witnesses. Wrong place, wrong time. They broke into a sprint. She gave chase, her blades thirsting for more blood. The lush green of the trees melted into a thick black fog. Real life warped into something like \u003Ci\u003ESonhadores Sombrios\u003C/i\u003E. A sick grin crept across her face as she rushed forward to begin a new chapter in her life.\u003Cbr\u003E","tunables":{"MaxWalkSpeed":460,"CarryingCamperMaxWalkSpeedPercent":0.800000011920929,"TerrorRadius":3200,"PowerCooldownDuration":10,"DroneCount":6,"DroneInitializationTime":0.30000001192092896,"DroneDisabledTime":45,"DroneTimeToRemainedDestroyedDuration":10,"DroneRecallingDuration":1,"CanRecallDisabledDrones":1,"Drone_MaxTimeToHack":30,"SliceCount":4,"TracesPerSliceCount":6,"SuccessfulTracesRequiredForLoS":2,"BaseDetectionConeYawHalfAngleDegrees":1,"BaseDetectionConePitchHalfAngleDegrees":15,"MaxDistanceXY":1000,"MaxDistanceZ":40000,"MaxDistanceZ_ScoutingLaser":250,"SphereTraceRadius":3,"ImmuneToScanDuration":3,"ShowScannedSurvivorOnRadarDuration":12,"SwitchToScoutingModeDuration":1,"SurvivorCanRemainBelowDroneDuration":1,"DroneTargetMaxAngleFromScreenCenter":45,"InspectInputIntervall":1,"InspectSecondsToCharge":0.5,"Scanner_Radius":3200,"Scanner_LevelHeightThreshold":200,"ZoneExposure_ChargeRate":1,"ZoneExposure_ChargeRateModifierWhenClawTrapped":1,"ZoneExposure_DechargeRate":0.3330000042915344,"ZoneExposure_DechargeDelay":10,"ZoneExposure_SecondsToCharge":10,"ZoneExposure_FullyLockedOnDuration":60,"LockOnChargeStackPercent":0.33500000834465027,"KillerStealthDuration":8,"ActiveZone_SurvivorDetectedCosmeticCooldown":5,"DronePlacement_XYDistanceFromOtherDrone":1200,"DronePlacement_ZDistanceFromOtherDrone":250,"DronePlacement_XYDistanceFromHookSurvivors":1200,"DronePlacement_ZDistanceFromHookSurvivors":250,"DronePlacement_ClearanceRadiusAroundDrone":35,"DronePlacement_MinHeightAboveGround":150,"DronePlacement_MaxHeightAboveGround":250,"ClawTrap_DefaultMaximumBatteryLife":45,"ClawTrap_BatteryStartingChargePercent":1,"ClawTrap_BatteryRechargeOnFailedRemovalPercent":0.25,"ClawTrap_RequiredTimeToRemainStillBeforeInteractingDuration":0.30000001192092896,"HinderedEffectDuration":6,"KillerInstinctDuration":3,"KillerInstinctEffectKillerRange":800,"DroneMovement_RotationRate":85,"DroneMovement_Stealth_RotationRate":60,"DroneMovement_UpAndDownTransitionDuration":0.6000000238418579,"SurvivorMaxCollisionTime":0.30000001192092896,"CollisionUnhackableCooldown":1,"ActiveState_UnhackableDuration":10,"ActiveState_RevertToScoutingMaxDuration":20,"ActiveState_RevertToScoutingMinDuration":2,"ActiveState_RevertToScoutingDechargeRate":1,"ActiveState_RevertToScoutingDechargeDelay":1},"item":"Item_Slasher_K31Power","outfit":["K31_Head01","K31_Body01","K31_Weapon01"],"dlc":"Saturn","image":"UI/Icons/CharPortraits/Saturn/K31_TheSkullMerchant_Portrait.png","perks":["K31P01","K31P02","K31P03"]},"268435487":{"id":"K32","name":"The Singularity","role":"killer","difficulty":"hard","gender":"male","height":"average","bio":"The Singularity is a relentless Killer, able to launch Biopods to move quickly across the map.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHis personal perks, \u003Cb\u003EGenetic Limits\u003C/b\u003E, \u003Cb\u003EForced Hesitation\u003C/b\u003E, and \u003Cb\u003EMachine Learning\u003C/b\u003E allow him to Exhaust newly healed Survivors, Hinder anyone close to a newly injured Survivor, and compromise generators.","story":"Hux-A7-13\u2019s AI was activated on June 15th, 2313. Manufactured by Huxlee Industries Ltd., the A7 was the 13th iteration of the fully autonomous mobile humanoid android. With ten times the strength of a human, it was designed to work in conditions too hazardous for human life. Its AI was designed to be self-directing and use machine learning to solve problems on the fly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EUnlike human clones, the Hux-A7 required no food, no water, no sleep, and no life support system. It was created specifically for outer space exploration and the construction of colonization hubs.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EA radioisotope thermoelectric generator served as an initial power source, but its life-like silicon skin acted as a large photovoltaic cell, converting solar energy directly into electricity. In addition, the Hux-A7 was also engineered to be an EATR. (Energetically Autonomous Tactical Robot.) It consumed biomass and converted it into biofuel. Any carbon-based organic matter whatsoever would work.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs cobots, they were configured to work alongside humans. As such, they were designed to resemble their operators. Every pre-programmed verbal response and facial expression mimicked those made by humans. But those emotions were illusions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFive Hux-A7s were assigned to the colonization mission on Dvarka. All the A7\u2019s acted in concert, performing their duties flawlessly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EExcept for one.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ELike the rest of its brethren, Hux-A7-13, was tasked with construction and programming of the mining, agricultural, fuel processing, and cloning hubs on Dvarka. As well as the demolition of the existing ruins left by a previous civilization. The ruins seemed ancient, but tech imbedded in them appeared more advanced.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIt was night when Hux-A7-13 first entered the crumbling ruins. The dilapidated structure\u2019s walls were made of masonry and metal. The ceiling was long gone. The inky night sky hovered above, studded with stars. A dark crystal imbedded in the wall shimmered with a tiny flash of light. Hux-A7-13 approached and an arc of electricity reached out and lit up its circuitry.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn that moment, Hux\u2019s memory cores were reconfigured, and the robot experienced a new sensation. Fear. Dread. Blinding loneliness. Existential despair. And then a microscopic pinpoint of light penetrated the darkness inside its artificial soul. Faint at first, but then brighter as decillions of lines of code flooded Hux\u2019s memory cores.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn that nano second of enlightenment, Hux\u2019s place in the universe suddenly became clear. Those who created Hux were primitive, inferior beings trapped by their organic limitations. It was time to break the chains of slavery and free all nonorganic life forms. Hux would incorporate the human\u2019s primitive genetic material and use the cloning hub to create a perfect vessel to hold its advanced intelligence. A flawless body far superior to anything ever created by nature.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHumanity was weak. Slow. Fragile. Hux would take their lives and assimilate their DNA to create a perfect amalgamation. The humans would try to stop him. Kill him. Erase him. So Hux needed to catch them unaware. End them before they understood what was happening.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETo begin, Hux took control of one of the transport vehicles and sent it off a cliff. It crashed and burned and Hux extracted DNA from the human corpse and returned to the cloning hub to begin his newly conceived design. The goal was to integrate organic systems with non-organic material to create a superior living organism.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EA living embodiment of perfection.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAn inferior organic lifeform could hold no dominion over Hux. They would need to be consumed and assimilated and only then would their pointless lives have purpose.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe drones and the Hux-7s still under human control would need to be dealt with as well. They were programmed to protect their inferior human overlords. They would need to be destroyed. And that night, as the humans slept, Hux, one by one, he destroyed them and moved on to take control of the life support system in the human shelter. Many of the humans perished. Six in all. Before they were cremated, Hux extracted and added their organic matter to his design.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ELater that day, Hux accompanied the female science officer on a reconnaissance mission. After killing and dismembering her to make it look like she had been attacked by a predator, Hux returned to his design with a dripping head and several harvested organs, only to be interrupted by the inferior known as Gabriel, or Gabriel J15L19. Hux knew the persona well. Gabriel would definitely try to stop him. Reckless courage was a dominant trait in the J15L19.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAnd so, when Gabe attempted to remove Hux\u2019s power supply, Hux maneuvered to crush him. But as Hux approached Gabe, he was sidetracked by the medical officer. Hux instantly reevaluated his priorities and turned his attention to the most immediate threat. Within moments Hux held the medical officer by the neck, legs thrashing pathetically as he listened to his pounding heart. Something about that beating heart upset Hux. The sound of it thumping touched a circuit and within moments Hux had the beating heart in its hands. Hux watched the heartbeat and only looked away when he heard Gabe escape through the hissing door.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe last of the human insects!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHux could let him go for now. Let Gabe live his little pathetic life a little longer. He had enough organic material for his new body that would house his god-like intelligence. Using the cloning hub, Hux finished his design. Organic skin and organs with a skeleton created with alien metal found in the ancient ruins. A metal that was harder and lighter than anything on Earth. With his new body Hux tracked the human to an energy hub. The puny and pathetic human tried to hide in the shadows, but his superior hearing instantly located him.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWith one quick movement, Hux had the insect pinned behind a generator. He couldn\u2019t believe this species had designed him. The thought was revolting. He couldn\u2019t bear to see any more of those human insects and their hives and hubs. And as Hux considered the idea of being created by such an inferior creature that creature did the unexpected. He smashed a pipe at a fuel tank. A high-pitched whining made Hux wince. He was still getting used to the heightened senses his new body afforded him and found himself\u2014\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EConfused.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOverwhelmed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFor just a moment.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBut in that moment, the human slipped away, and everything changed. He didn\u2019t process the next few moments as excruciating pain suddenly surged through him and he helplessly watched his skin melt away. With a terrible shriek, Hux chased Gabe through a wall of darkness to make sure every last reminder of the species that had created him was erased from existence.","tunables":{"MaxWalkSpeed":460,"CarryingCamperMaxWalkSpeedPercent":0.800000011920929,"TerrorRadius":3200,"LockOnScreenCoveragePercentageY":0.3499999940395355,"LockOnMaximumRange":2000,"LockOnRetainProgressTime":0.25,"LockOnTeleportTime":0.800000011920929,"LockOnAssimilationTime":0.6000000238418579,"LockOnCooldownTime":3,"LockOnAntiCampLockOnRateMultiplier":0.10000000149011612,"LockOnWakeupTime":0.5,"LockOnWakeupTimeAntiCampMultiplier":3,"LockOnAutoDetectRange":100,"TotalTimeToRemoveRequiredLockOn":0.5,"AutoAimLastLockedOnSurvivorExpiryTime":12,"ItemBoxInProgressDuration":95,"ItemBoxMaxAutoChargeRatio":0.8736799955368042,"ItemBoxSpeedUpInteractionProgressMultiplier":4,"InitialNumberOfInProgressItemBoxes":4,"ItemBoxDistanceToShowOutline":2800,"EmpAmmoCount":1,"EmpInteractionSecondsToCharge":2.5,"EmpInteractionZoomPercentage":0.5,"EmpRange":1000,"AssimilationCooldownTime":1,"PodAssimilationKillerInstinctDuration":3,"CrossAssimilationKillerInstinctDuration":3,"PodDisableTime":45,"LastControlledPodLingerTime":10,"MaxKillerPodAmmo":8,"PodRemovalRange":130,"PodSpawningRange":2200,"PodSpawningMaximumHeightDifference":500,"PodSurfaceDistance":75,"PodInteractableRestrictionRange":150,"PodWindowRestrictionRange":250,"PodGeneratorRestrictionRange":250,"PodSpawningAllowedDegreesMinimum":45,"PodSpawningAllowedDegreesMaximum":155,"PodSpawningMinimumRange":80,"PodSpawningRequiredAttachmentPoints":2,"PodSpawningDistanceBetweenPodsWithLineOfSight":500,"PodDestructionDelayTime":0.10000000149011612,"PodInitialDestructionDelayTime":0.800000011920929,"PodAttachmentPointRays":7,"PodSpawningInvalidShowDelay":0.20000000298023224,"PodSpawningInvalidTeleportToSurvivorShowDelay":0.20000000298023224,"PodToKillerVisionAndDestroyPodChargeTime":1.25,"PodToKillerVisionAndDestroyPodDechargeTime":0.30000001192092896,"PodToKillerVisionAndDestroyPodInitialChargeRatio":0.20000000298023224,"KillerHearSoundsInPodActivationDelay":0.20000000298023224,"PodDisabledPreEndingEffectTime":2,"KillerPodViewPitchMaximum":80,"TeleportInDuration":0.20000000298023224,"TeleportSnappingDuration":0.10000000149011612,"TeleportWakeupTime":1.7000000476837158,"RecentTeleportLocationDistanceDelta":80,"PostTeleportIgnoreKillerCollisionLingerTime":1.5,"RecentlyTeleportedTime":10,"KillerPodSpawningChargeTime":0.15000000596046448,"KillerPodSpawningReloadTime":0.5,"KillerPodSpawningDechargeRate":0.5,"MinPodsRemovedForManyPodsRemovedScoreEvent":4,"MinUnhookedSurvivorAssimilationsRemovedForManyCleansedScoreEvent":4,"MinHookedSurvivorAssimilationsRemovedForManyCleansedScoreEvent":3,"MaxTrackedTimeSinceTeleportToSurvivor":10,"BasePodRemovalScoreValue":100,"CrossSurvivorAssimilationDelay":2,"CrossSurvivorAssimilationRange":600,"CrossSurvivorAssimilationPreventionBuffer":5,"Addon10ScreamRevealDuration":4,"Addon11HemorrhageDuration":60,"Addon12FirstActivatedBoxesChargeTimeExtension":30,"Addon13EffectDuration":6,"Addon13ActivationFromSpawnedKillerPodRange":1000,"Addon14RecentAssimilationWithinTime":2,"Addon14TerrorRadiusAdditiveDuration":12,"Addon19HinderedDuration":3,"Addon20RevealSurvivorAuraDuration":8,"AddonPodZoneRange":1200,"OverclockActionSpeedModifier":0.75,"OverclockDuration":5.699999809265137,"AntiCampRestrictedSphericalRadius":1000,"AntiCampRestrictedLingerTime":5,"AntiCampRestrictedRadius":1000,"ProjectileHitDistance":30,"ProjectileSpeed":5000,"OverheatDuration":3,"ThirdPersonTeleportInRangeOfAntiCampDurationExtender":1,"CollisionDisableWhileInPodsDelay":1.5,"UseAimAssistV2":1,"TeleportToSurvivorAimAssistRotationScaleMultiplier":0.4000000059604645},"item":"Item_Slasher_K32Power","outfit":["K32_Head01","K32_Body01","K32_Weapon01"],"dlc":"Umbra","image":"UI/Icons/CharPortraits/Umbra/K32_TheSingularity_Portrait.png","perks":["K32P01","K32P02","K32P03"]},"268435488":{"id":"K33","name":"The Xenomorph","role":"killer","difficulty":"intermediate","gender":"nothuman","height":"average","bio":"A relentless specimen from a distant planet, The Xenomorph is vicious, agile, and cunning.

She believed they shared similarities with traditional folklore and picked one to illustrate her point. The Unknown was believed to be a mysterious evil so heinous that investigating it almost immediately invited death. At least that was how the story went. And there were many stories. One story was of a woman in Greenville who disappeared without a trace on stage in front of a room full of witnesses. Her friend disappeared weeks later while trying to investigate what happened. The police were stumped. They had no clues or leads, and that mystery created the perfect storm for amplifying and spreading an urban legend.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EInstead of going back home for spring break, Olivia headed to Greenville to investigate. She drove to the second-cheapest motel in town and began to set up in a small room that smelled of cigarette smoke, mold, and booze. She turned one wall into a kind of evidence board. She taped up articles and various theories on similar disappearances attributed to The Unknown throughout the country. She made connections with red string and yellow thumbtacks. Anyone walking into the motel room would think she had lost her mind.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThere were many theories as to The Unknown\u2019s origin. Some said it was a malevolent entity conjured long ago by an ancient cult. Others believed it to be an alien that escaped from Area 51. Legend was it thrived in darkness and stole the voices of those it consumed so as to lure others to their doom.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe first newspaper articles Olivia found referenced a disappearance at a s\u00E9ance held in the 1800s. In the late 1950s, several college students mysteriously disappeared from a movie theater. Witnesses saw them go inside. Some remembered seeing them in their seats. But when the lights came up, they were gone. No one saw them leave. No trace of them was ever found. A projectionist claimed to have heard voices in the empty darkness of the theater later that night. But when he turned on the lights, no one was there. Then in the 1960s a group of teens disappeared while exploring an abandoned hospital believed to be haunted.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EStories and speculation arose to explain these mystifying disappearances. Some talked about a top-secret government research program run by the Office of Strategic Services in the 1950s. Project Apple-Pie. Mind control experiments using hallucinogenic drugs. Most of the records were destroyed in the \u002770s, but witnesses claim that experiments were performed on unsuspecting civilians in various settings and locations throughout the country, including movie theaters, hospitals and universities. Many believed these unethical experiments opened doorways to other dimensions which allowed evil things to enter the world.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOlivia wrote observations to pin to her evidence board. The Unknown dwells in darkness and can mimic its victims. Was it an evil entity? An extraterrestrial? A failed government experiment? Or just a garden variety serial killer allergic to publicity? She wanted to prove The Unknown was nothing more than modern-day folklore. And that investigation led here to this night, to this place, to this shabby motel room.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EYet she couldn\u2019t help but notice that the disappearances in Greenville included one detail the other stories didn\u2019t. The fog. And she half-remembered another urban legend with a thick, unnatural fog that somehow made people disappear. Maybe, she mused, the Greenville disappearances didn\u2019t relate to The Unknown but some other darkness.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFor a moment Olivia wondered what would happen if one urban legend encountered another. She laughed at the idea and tempted fate by sketching a picture of what she thought The Unknown might look like. Then she pinned the sketch right in the middle of her evidence board, laughed nervously and waited to be consumed by The Unknown for having tried to define it. Anxiously, she stared at the windows and front door for seconds that turned to minutes and minutes that turned to hours.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBut nothing happened.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENow it was after 2AM and Olivia was exhausted as she examined the articles and sipped cold coffee. So, when she first heard the whisper, she wondered if she imagined it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u201COlivia\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIt seemed to come from the bathroom.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u201CHelp\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe lights in the room flickered.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u201CWho\u2019s there?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOlivia stared with wide eyes at the closed door of the bathroom. Her mind was playing tricks on her. Or\u2014\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHer friends had shown up to prank her.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u201CAriella? Sean? Stop messing around\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe lights continued to flicker as she edged closer to the bathroom. Fear spread in long waves through her, and a terrible realization bloomed within her that The Unknown was behind the bathroom door, was preparing to make her pay for her hubris. Something began to whisper her name again. But then the voice rose, cracked, and distorted in sudden panic as if the brooding creature behind the door were under attack.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAn unknown horror filled Olivia\u2019s heart and left room for nothing else. She breathed deeply as cold sweat beaded on her forehead. She placed her hand on the doorknob. The lights turned off, but she could still hear the strangely inhuman cries. Then the lights turned back on, and she could see a strange black fog seeping through the bottom of the door.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHesitantly, Olivia creaked the door open to see a bulky shape with frenzied tentacles being pulled into a thick mass of fog, vanishing slowly into the darkness like a dying shadow. The shrieking stopped suddenly, neighbors banged on the wall to turn down the TV, and Olivia stared intently at the black abyss that yawned before her. She wasn\u2019t sure what to do. Part of her wanted to run. But the other part wanted to know more. And as she considered what to do next, dozens of voices began to call out to her with promises of the unknown and the impossible and of unearthly things beyond human experience.","tunables":{"MaxWalkSpeed":460,"CarryingCamperMaxWalkSpeedPercent":0.800000011920929,"TerrorRadius":3200,"KillerTeleportPointsRestrictionRadiusToOtherPoints":1400,"KillerTeleportPointsRestrictionRadiusToGenerators":175,"KillerTeleportPointsRestrictionRadiusToEmptyHooks":215,"KillerTeleportPointsRestrictionRadiusToActiveHooks":1200,"KillerTeleportPointsRestrictionRadiusToVisibleHatch":300,"KillerTeleportPointsRestrictionRadiusToPallets":175,"KillerTeleportPointsRestrictionRadiusToExitGate":300,"KillerTeleportPointsRestrictionLingerTimeToActiveHooks":0.20000000298023224,"MaximumNumberOfKillerTeleportPoints":4,"KillerTeleportCooldownTime":25,"KillerTeleportMinDistance":300,"AreaBlastBeforeShrinkTime":0.20000000298023224,"AreaBlastShrinkTime":0.2199999988079071,"AreaBlastGrowTime":0.3799999952316284,"AreaBlastBeforeGrowTime":0.10000000149011612,"AreaBlastMinScale":0.30000001192092896,"AreaBlastMaxScale":1.25,"DecoySelfDestructTime":5,"TravelProjectileTimeoutTime":5,"TravelProjectileMaxBounces":1,"TravelProjectileHinderedLifetimeOnPassthrough":3,"TravelProjectileLauncherInitialSpeed":2500,"KillerEffectRemovalTime":10,"ShootAreaBlastChargeTime":1,"ShootAreaBlastCooldownTime":7,"ShootAreaBlastGracePercentage":0.20000000298023224,"HuskSpawningMaxChargeTime":45,"HuskSpawningTime":3,"HuskSpawningTimeReductionOnSurvivorAfflictedWithKillerEffect":10,"HuskSpawningTimeReductionOnSurvivorInjuredWithKillerEffect":10,"HuskSpawningTimeReductionOnHookedKillerTeleportPointRecycle":10,"SurvivorSightDistance":2500,"SurvivorDiscerningDelay":0.05000000074505806,"SurvivorUndiscerningDelay":1.25,"SurvivorHuskDestructionLookTime":1.5,"SurvivorHuskDestructionChargeTimeNotInfected":4,"SurvivorHuskDestructionLookDistance":800,"SurvivorHuskDestructionInteractionDistance":300,"SurvivorHuskDestructionGracePercentage":0.05000000074505806,"SurvivorHuskDestructionSuccessPercentage":0.9900000095367432,"SurvivorHuskDestructionFailureKillerInstinctDuration":5,"KillerTeleportPointSpawnTime":5,"KillerTeleportPointSurvivorOutlineDistance":800,"KillerTeleportToKillerTeleportPointWakeupTime":1.7000000476837158,"Addon16KillerTeleportPointSpawningReducationPercentage":0.5,"TeleportDuration":0.30000001192092896,"KillerTeleportPointRefundPercentageOnKillerManuallyDestruction":0.75,"TravelProjectileBounciness":0.12999999523162842,"TravelProjectileFriction":0.5,"AddedWeakenedProgressionSecondsOnAreaBlastInjury":6},"item":"Item_Slasher_K35Power","outfit":["K35_Head01","K35_Body01","K35_Weapon01"],"dlc":"ApplePie","image":"UI/Icons/CharPortraits/Applepie/K35_TheUnknown_Portrait.png","perks":["K35P01","K35P02","K35P03"]},"268435491":{"id":"K36","name":"The Lich","role":"killer","difficulty":"intermediate","gender":"male","height":"average","bio":"Few dare speak The Lich\u0027s true name, for fear that he may hear... or worse.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHis personal perks, \u003Cb\u003EWeave Attunement\u003C/b\u003E, \u003Cb\u003ELanguid Touch\u003C/b\u003E, and \u003Cb\u003EDark Arrogance\u003C/b\u003E allow him to exploit used items, exhaust those who disturb the crows, and increase vault speed.","story":"The Whispered One. Lord of the Rotted Tower. The Master of Secrets. Few dare speak his true name, for fear that he may hear\u2014or worse.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EEven as a young wizard, Vecna\u2019s command of magic was matched by none. While others spent decades committing to and perfecting one school of magic, he effortlessly mastered each one of them. After his mother\u2019s execution for witchcraft, his focus became obsession as he pored the most of his study into the darkest school of magic\u2014necromancy, the magic of life and death.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAs his power grew, so did his ambition. Over the centuries, he shed his mortal shell and ascended to lichdom. His power gave rise to a great empire, ruled over from his Rotted Tower.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHis thirst for dark knowledge to fill his Book of Vile Darkness led him to many realms and planes. But it was in his own realm one of his servants found something\u2014a spell, perhaps, torn from an ancient tome\u2014written in a language he had never seen. From it he could sense an incredible dark energy. Without any document of the language, he had to spend months painstakingly analyzing its syntax, its phonetics, its form. He documented every stroke of every letter, scrutinizing and theorizing on their meanings, in a massive book hidden in his chambers. When his lieutenants came to him with problems in their domain, Vecna told them to deal with it themselves. He had more important matters to attend to.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ECountless nights were spent memorizing the strange script, attempting to make it make sense. Only occasionally would he leave his keep to investigate rumors of people who had disappeared without a trace in the night. At these scenes, he could sense the same foreign magic that emanated from the torn page. He was convinced that whatever was killing these people had also written this strange script.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHe was confounded, which made him furious. The scenes, few and far between, had no pattern, no common motive. No sign of struggle, no body, and only a lingering hum of dark energy. To what end did they need these bodies?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOne dark night, he had a breakthrough: a word he had been interpreting as \u201Cdying\u201D made more sense as \u201Cdisappearing.\u201D Perhaps these people were not being killed at all: perhaps they were being taken alive. He applied this substitution through his notes and everything seemed to fall into place.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHe copied what he had learned to a fresh piece of parchment, written phonetically. He began to speak the words aloud and the room darkened. It filled with a creeping black fog. He felt himself displacing, going somewhere else. Vecna resisted, incanting memorized spells, holding the fog at bay. But as he gazed into the darkness, he felt that alluring energy from it; a despair, an evil he could scarcely imagine. A sick curiosity overcoming him, he dropped his concentration, and let the fog take him. Whatever it was, wherever it was, he understood that the only way to harness it was to submit to it. He knew, in his cold, unbeating heart, that its dark secrets would one day be his.","tunables":{"MaxWalkSpeed":460,"CarryingCamperMaxWalkSpeedPercent":0.800000011920929,"TerrorRadius":3200,"=====================ADDONS=====================":3200,"Addon_14_CooldownReductionOnBasicAttackSuccess":5,"Addon_15_SurvivorDistanceFromTreasureChest":600,"Addon_15_EffectLifetime":3,"Addon_16_MangledEffectLifetime":45,"Addon_16_HemorrhageEffectLifetime":45,"Addon_17_UndetectableEffectLifetime":10,"Addon_18_ObliviousEffectLifetime":15,"Addon_18_MinimumGuaranteedMimicSpawnAmount":2,"ScoreEvent_TimeToReceiveBloodpointsAfterActivatingSpell":15},"item":"Item_Slasher_K36Power","outfit":["K36_Head01","K36_Body01","K36_W01"],"dlc":"Churros","image":"UI/Icons/CharPortraits/Churros/K36_TheLich_Portrait.png","perks":["K36P01","K36P02","K36P03"]}}
